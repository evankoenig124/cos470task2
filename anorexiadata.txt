I'm a 19 (F) and I guess this is my story. Death seems like a great solution. 2013-10-08 14:07:15 reddit post I'm a 19 year old girl. I'm mentally ill. I don't think I've ever fully typed out my life story on a website, or written it down anywhere before, so prepare for a TLDR or skip to the bottom. Ever since I was a young child, domestic abuse was a common thing growing up. My father was abusive towards my family and I, and we had to put it up with it almost every single day. Everyone suffered. My sisters, my mother, even my own relatives suspected what was going on but no one intervened. At age 12, I was molested by my first therapist/counselor at school, I kept it a secret until my early teens. Bullying seemed of the norm or common to me, so I put up with that as well as my grades suffered. I was in denial of what happened for a very long time and I During high school at age 15, I experienced a traumatic experience from an incident with my dad and I had to leave the house the move in with my aunt. CPS and the police were involved, I had to go to court a lot, it was horrible. I developed my eating disorder at this age and I ended up dropping out of school. I was not missed. From then on, everything got worse. Suicide/OD attempts, jumping into traffic, self-harm, binging and purging- I hated myself. I experienced a lot of shitty traumatic events. I put myself in unhealthy relationships, dropped out of college, and ended up having to go to rehab because I decided I needed help after having my whole family just get so sick of it. I was definitely not sober before rehab, but I pretended to function well and it was taking a toll on my body, along with my eating disorder which is currently very active. When I left rehab, I relapsed. I took all my sleeping pills (a months worth) in one go and drank some booze. I was saved by my sister. After I left the hospital, I went into an eating disorders program, and got discharged the first day I was there. I basically; could not do it or handle it. I am not allowed there again, obviously- and my shitty therapist decided to drop me because she didn't want to be liable for anything in case I actually do kill myself. Now I am left with no therapist, I am currently in an extremely dysfunctional relationship with someone who constantly puts me down, and I always find myself loving him more than he loves me.. But I don't have anyone else.. and I have NO friends, or family to confide in. I have no job, I can't go to school right now until January, and I'm desperately trying to find help. I feel stupid and useless, and ugly, and just a waste of space. Everything just seems really fucking terrible. And I've put my mother in debt about 50 grand... I just really wish I were dead this time. 2013-10-07 12:17:02 reddit post two experiences. My grandma and auntie had made some shanghainese food- simmered pork belly, lobster, with the roe and egg noodles, and shrimp+pork stuffed hot peppers. Another was when I was in the hospital, almost dying and eating liquidy bullshit, Ensure, and fake ass eggs for 3 days, later I decided to order some Thai food while I was still in there and it was literally the best thing I've ever tasted. Fucking spicy goodness. 2013-10-06 06:30:16 reddit post my sister and I walked in on our grandpas caretaker screaming because.. he somehow "accidentally" stabbed himself in the eyeball when we were little kids 2013-10-02 13:42:52 reddit post crying. 2013-10-01 07:14:50 reddit post wtFFuuHHuhaskjaf. ??? 2013-10-01 05:47:06 reddit post Ridiculously photogenic male bungee jumps in wheel chair.

subject1637 Any tips to improve essay writing speed? 2014-05-03 19:48:54 reddit post I'm apparently a very slow writer, because I didn't finish my essay this time. After 1 minute of planning, I began writing non-stop until the proctor said, "pencils down." In the end, I wrote a page and a half. So how can I improve that? I'm working to make my essays better in other ways, but how can I write quicker and fill up more space? What am I doing wrong on essays? 2014-04-28 22:00:16 reddit post I took the SAT twice, got an 8 both times. None of the guides or tips I find online have helped. So I took a 25 minute practice essay, with a prompt I found online. Can anyone identify my mistakes? Prompt: "That which we obtain too easily, we esteem too lightly. It is dearness only which gives everything its value." -Thomas Paine Do we value only what we struggle for? Plan your response, and then write an essay to explain your views on this issue. Be sure to support your position with specific points and examples. (You may use personal examples or examples from your reading, observations, or, knowledge of subjects such as history, literature, science.) People only value what they struggle for. Only by overcoming obstacles can a person truly achieve. Without challenge, there can be no triumph. Without triumph, we cannot full appreciate what we have. This fundamental truth is reflected through subjects as diverse as history and literature. Sometimes, people get something for nothing. Some people are born with money, power, and ability. King Charles I of England inherited a monarchy, and his lack of appreciation for political power caused his Parliament to turn against him in the First English Civil War. If he had struggled and fought for his position, Charles would have known he true value of the crown. This is further reflected in his successor, Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, who refused the English crown in favor of a republic in which "those who provide by the sweat of their brow" can appreciate power. A person who does not work for himself cannot appreciate his lot. George Orwell's novel, "Animal Farm," was all about his shortfall of communism. The happiest of all the animals was Boxer, the horse who put in all the work to achieve his success. Because he struggled, he had a deep, honest pride in his work. Other animals, like the pigs, made no effort. Snowball took power without competition, and subsequently lost sight of the value of compromise. When Napoleon ousted Snowball, he did so by force. Neither pig struggled, and as a consequence both were unhappy and incompetent. Without struggle, there can be no understanding the real value of achievement. Success is measured not by raw magnitude of victory, but by resistance overcome. Nobody can appreciate the vast difficulty of a task without completing it. And there is no pride in accomplishment without conflict. IWTL Economics 2014-04-26 08:16:37 reddit post I'm really interested in learning economics, but I don't know where to begin. My High School doesn't have an economics class or club. I haven't found much online. I tried listening to Planet Money, and it's really cool, but not what I'm looking for. I'm a complete beginner; I've never studied economics at all, and I want to start. I want a real, basic, Economics 101 course, online or in print. A podcast would be great, but I haven't found any of what I'm trying to find on ITunes. Why did European colonialism create such a messed up situation in Africa, but not in South America? 2014-04-18 22:08:29 reddit post I look at the political map of Africa, and I cringe. So many countries, borders all screwed up, countries inside countries, etc. And Sub-Saharan Africa is generally the poorest, least developed region in the world, from my understanding. Yet South America is similar in climate and terrain, but today a political map of South America is border porn. To me, at least, it has a beautiful division of land between just a handful of nations, and while that continent certainly has its own problems, they aren't nearly as bad as Africa's. Why is this? What sort of extracurriculars does UVa value highly? 2014-04-14 05:40:36 reddit post I'm a Hugh School Junior, and I have a wide variety of EC's right now, including Fencing, Model UN, Computer Science, Boy Scouts, and theatre. I've got some free time over the summer between internships that I want to use to beef up my application. What extracurricular activities would most impress UVa admissions? Music? Volunteering? A sport? Thanks! EDIT: I've got a lot of great advice, thanks guys! Just wanted to elaborate a bit. The reason I'm focusing on EC's is because my GPA is sub-par. 3.8 on a 5.0 scale, and about 3.3 unweighted. My SAT scores are near perfect, 2350. In addition, I've taken the most rigorous curriculum possible, and my school is a well-respected private institution. So the only thing that really brings me down is grades, and those are definitely improving. I just want to maximize my chances by becoming as well-rounded as possible.

But my test scores are good, 2250, and, I'm taking the SAT twice more. I'm also in the process of finding a college to attend. Are there any well-respected universities that care a lot about SAT scores, and less about gpa? I can't get into UVa 2014-03-31 02:43:00 reddit post Fuck. It's my top choice for a uni. I can't get in. There's no way. Why? Because of my fucking gpa. My god damn fucking gpa. Everything else is perfect. I've taken the highest level classes my school offers. I've taken two elective AP classes. I got a 2250 on my SAT's and I'm taking them two more times. I've been an exceptional Model UN delegate since I was a freshman. TWICE I've interned for Navy engineers, PAID. I'm an Eagle Scout. And the highest cumulative gpa that a university is going to see is a 3.7. I can get a 4.5 this semester. I got a 4.1 last semester. But freshman and sophomore year I got 3.3 and 3.6. I'm so fucking upset. UVa accepts applicants with an average of 4.2 gpa. If I got a 4.0 maybe I could squeak by. But no. No matter how hard I work, I'll be fucked for college. "Late-game" help? I need advice to bring my scores up from a 2250 to a 2300+. 2014-03-28 02:19:31 reddit post I've checked out advice for taking the SAT given by College Board and by other test professionals, but they seem to be focused on turning average scores into good ones (~1500 to ~2000). But my scores are 760-740-750 Reading Math Writing. I feel like many of the normal tips and strategies wouldn't apply, like skipping all questions I'm unsure of. While that would obviously be good if I've been getting a few dozen questions wrong, in this case I only missed one or two per section. The worst of it is that all three sections are relatively even, and I don't have an 800 in any of them. Can anyone give some advice geared towards someone shooting for a perfect 2400?

Pictures of my current hair: http://i.imgur.com/PWoa3bP.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Yi50K11.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Sze80mv.jpg http://i.imgur.com/A2Ukh2Q.jpg http://i.imgur.com/FObZfT7.jpg I tried to get the best pictures possible. The costumer told me that it was too long in the back and around the ears. I would appreciate pictures if possible. And while I know that hair grows back, we open in less than a week. So I think a safe haircut would be served best here. If "1960's style" is a silly category, let me know. I'll talk to the costumer and narrow it down. Thanks in advance! What was the lineage of wealthy plantation owners in the pre-Civil War Southern US? 2014-03-08 20:09:35 reddit post I have been wondering this for some time now.

Or did some impoverished families come to the New World from Europe, and eventually become the landowning, rich, powerful Southern plantation families?

I've made good progress on fixing the berry system, and I'm in the process of learning some ASM so that I can change how the clock works. But I've hit an issue with so-called "PlantID's". Naturally, a PlantID identifies which plot of land each soil event is, as they all use the same script. But I can't seem to find out how to change the properties of the PlantID's. You know how in the vanilla game you will find soil plots with plants already fully grown in them? Yeah, I'm trying to change it so that the soil plots start off empty, with absolutely nothing growing in them. Anybody know how I could do that? Just got this cheap sweater today.

But I went to two conferences in the past month, one an EU GA committee and one a semi-crisis Historical UNSC. I think I've decided that while I enjoy I enjoyed planning for them beforehand and talking about them afterward, crises are not the most fun while I'm in committee. People get silly, there are too few delegates, and I really prefer resolutions over directives. Plus, I like working with a partner to get things done; most of the other delegates at my school make excellent partners, and all of us are very versatile in our MUN talents. I've attended at least two dozen conferences, and most of the time I made an effort to get a crisis committee. But next conference I'm going to get a GA.

That means every finger with a cut, itch, dry spot, etc. It only works with a gauze-like classic bandaid, a plastic one won't work. When I have the urge to bite or pick, I bite on the bandaid.

Are most of /r/MUN's readers College students, or High School? 2014-02-01 16:56:02 reddit post I've only done MUN at the high school level, so I don't know quite how popular it is in College. I want to have a CS major in college, but I don't know which CS major. Any help? 2014-01-30 03:06:19 reddit post I'm a Junior in HS, took 2 CS classes (Honors Intro to CS, and AP CS A). I'm confident that I want to take Computer Science as a major in college. However, when I look at the majors offered by different universities, I see TONS of majors with "Computer Science" in the name. Examples include: Computer Science Computer Engineering (General) Computer and Information Systems Security/Information Assurance and Mathematics and Computer Science. I really have little knowledge of the difference between these majors. Can anybody here shed some light on what these mean? If I want a job programming in the future, which one of these will be the most helpful? EDIT: I really need to clarify here. I don't know what college I want to attend yet, just that I want a CS-type degree. So I can't very well just take CS and switch if I feel like it, because the Uni I go to might not offer what I want. I want to ensure that before I pick a college, I have a good idea of what options I want. That said, I've pretty much been answered by now. Thanks for the input! TV Show: In a city where all police officers are hot-headed loose cannons, one cop fights crime with a responsible regard for the rules. 2014-01-27 02:15:14 reddit post Imagine it: Every cop is headstrong and reckless, except for one. When this man finds a dangerous situation, he responsibly calls for backup and waits. When a suspicious activity happens that was outside his directions, he radios back to HQ to get clearance to investigate. Other officers, whose plans consist of running into action guns blazing, are baffled at how this one man manages to consistently succeed at his job without breaking any rules or laws. The police chief might be another stickler for rules, and he would be very happy with the responsible cop and quite upset with everyone else. Or, the chief is also reckless, desribing the rules as "more like guidelines." Other major characters could include: The reckless buddy cop, who gradually is convinced that "by the books" actually is the best method. The single police dispatcher, who goes unused by most of the city because the cops are always running off and disregarding rules. He/she develops a close relationship with the main character, because he is the only one who calls him/her to request backup. A forensics expert, who is the only one in the entire forensics lab because nobody is willing to wait for the test results. I want to make the berry system functional in my Emerald hack.

So what traits or personalities would you like to see characters with? Newb mod idea: Time Travel 2014-01-19 21:17:45 reddit post I toyed with the thought for a while, and found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/he8mw/dwarven_time_travel/) from two years ago which pretty much sums it up. Create a world, let it run for 250 years, save all the worldgen data and start playing in Adventure Mode. At some point, your character could discover/create a time travel machine, which allows it to go both back and forward in time. If it goes forward, it just saves the world data and lets the world run for the time. To travel back to the original time, it just reloads the saved world data. To travel back in time, the mod would recreate the world, and, using the worldgen data, let it run until the year to which you travel. Then you can experience the world of the past, and when you travel back to your original time, the mod lets the world run until that year. So you could travel back in time, change events, and return to the present to find that, maybe, that Human town didn't get destroyed by an army of Goblins because a mysterious dwarf appeared to fend them off. And I also had a plan for dealing with your past self. The game records every action you personally make, and when you travel back two days to prevent yourself from being robbed by a kobol, your past self does exactly the same things you originally did. When that becomes impossible (like if it says that he should attack a kobol that he never met, is already dead and is buried 100 yards away), the AI assumes control of your past self. Would this work? Is it possible? I have a fair bit of programming experience, so I would like to work on this, but only if it has any possibility of working. EDIT: Also, if your past self dies, you do too. It wouldn't be possible to mess with other parodoxes because time travel is impossible. So the only real caveat to messing with the past is that if your past self dies, you also do. How could a permanent member be suspended or expelled from the Security Council? 2014-01-18 03:42:23 reddit post I'm going to JHUMUNC in February, and I'm in the SC as France. The topics are pretty polarizing, and even though I have some good plans for compromise, I would like this option as a backup. I know the rules differ between conference hosts, but JHUMUNC almost completely adheres to UN Procedure. So in the real Security Council, is there any realistic plan for suspending a permanent member? Could I go to the GA for help? Is there some obscure motion for this? EDIT: found a loophole. Resolution 2758 was a GA resolution that expelled the Republic of China (Taiwan) from the UN and accepted the People's Republic as the true representative of the Chinese nation. So to remove China, all you have to do is get the GA to repeal 2758. The PRC delegate then pretty much has to side with the West. I imagine that in a modern committee one could do the same with Russia. A neat little loophole, eh? I had a possible method/formula for writing mystery stories, I would like your opinion 2014-01-12 21:16:23 reddit post First off, I would like to say that I haven't written anything yet (except high school essays). I just get a lot of ideas, more often for methods than for actual stories. I've been toying with a method for writing a mystery, and I wanted to put it to paper and get another opinion. The way I see it, posting to /r/writing kills two birds with one stone. Method: 1. Write a tragedy. The tragedy should not involve the actual story's main character at all. This is because most events in mysteries are discovered rather than caused by the "detective". This tragedy should involve one or more deaths, several characters with clear desires, and a good heaping of dramatic irony. It doesn't have to be more than a summary of events. 2. Sketch a timeline of events for the tragedy. 3. About 1/4-1/2 of the way through the timeline pick a point for the story to begin. The point should be an event that, in the tragedy, is part of the rising action. In the mystery, it will act as the initiating event. 4. Decide whether the detective character will witness this event, or arrive after it occurs. 5. Begin writing from the detective's perspective. There should be little-to-no exposition about anything. Assume that the readers know the tragedy, and that you are just retelling it from the detective's POV. Have the detective use the first event as a starting point, and begin investigating. The detective's story should take him to some events in the tragedy, while others he should either not know or only discover later. The detective should either be present at the tragedy's conclusion, cause it or *prevent* it. While the mystery will start off the same as the tragedy, the detective's meddling may change some parts. I just wanted to get this out there, if you have an opinion or critique to give, great. [WP] Tell me the story of the Angry Fireman 2014-01-12 20:08:12 reddit post Never submitted a prompt before, let me know if I did something wrong, or used the wrong tag. Details: One of my hobbies is telling really long (~15 min) stories with an extremely anticlimactic "punchline". I find them very fun to just make up as I tell, and refine them the more times I tell them. Usually the prompt I give myself is something like "The [adjective] [noun]". "The Irish Lamppost," "The Windy Barn," "The Elastic Factory." They often seem nonsensical, but I try to work them into the stories. So, the Story of the Angry Fireman. Give it your best shot.

Redistribution of Socks 2014-01-05 21:05:28 reddit post Laundromats. They should add a feature to their washers/dryers. It counts the socks in the load. If the number is even, do nothing. If the number is odd, add/remove a sock from the load. Could someone help me understand offsets, and how to work with them? 2014-01-03 19:35:48 reddit post Ok, heres what I DO know and understand: 1. My computer has set aside a specific amount of 'data' for the rom. Each byte of that data is numbered in hexidecimal. Much of that data is occupied by scripts. There is also a certain amount that has no assigned value for the rom, so trying to access it without setting values for it will result in garbled gibberish. This is because there *is* information there, but it is information for other things, completely different from the rom. If I give these 'empty' bytes a value that makes sense for XSE, I can use them. 2. When I create a script, there is an offset at the beginning. This offset determines what byte the script will be stored from. So if I have a script of X bytes, and I use the offset 0x100000, the script will be stored in bytes 0x100000 to (0x100000+x). What I need to figure out: 1. How do I stop *my* scripts from getting in the way of the scripts the rom already has? When I compile new scripts, I often get them cut off halfway through by a script that was already at that offset, resulting in the first half of my code and then a bunch of useless code written by the original designers. 2. What is a dynamic offset, and how does it differ from a normal offset? 3. What is freespacefinder, and how does it work? If I ask it to look for, say, 200 bytes, it only gives me ~5 available offsets. Does this mean that there isn't enough free space to make a hack with more than 5 200 byte scripts? 4. Finally, a question I asked in an [earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1u76za/how_should_i_begin_making_a_completely_new_hack/): I want to start creating an entirely new hack, and the only resources from the base game I want to use will be the sprites and the basic systems. No scripts, no maps, I will make my own for all of them. How can I avoid the original scripts interfering with the scripts I write? Thanks! How should I begin making a completely new hack? 2014-01-02 03:23:19 reddit post Hey, I've messed around with PGE, XSE and AM for a few weeks now, trying to create a rom hack. Initially I thought that the easiest thing to do would be to make only minor adjustments to the base (Emerald) and get more complex after that. However, I ended up with a bunch of garbled scripts due to offset issues, and it got really annoying. So I've decided to make a completely original hack, with new maps, scripts, ect. Not changing the Pokemon at all. How would I start doing this? Should I delete every map, event and script in the game, and start from there? Or is there a better way?

He's well armed, but has no allies. The Dragonborn came fresh from the final battle with Alduin. He has access to his shouts, magic, weapons and armor. **ROUND TWO:** Same as above, but with allies. Courier 6 brings the army that captured/defended Hoover Dam; battered, but very well equipped. The Dragonborn brings the full might of Skyrim's ruling army, be it Imperial or Stormcloak. **EDIT** Just felt that a few things needed to be clarified: in Round 2, Courier 6 gets every soldier who fought on his side at the Second Battle of Hoover Dam. The Dragonborn gets every soldier in Skyrim who is his ally. So while Courier 6 has the Bommer plane, and the BoS, the Dragonborn has on his side: * Every Stormcloak/Imperial soldier in Skyrim (depending on his chosen side) * The Thieves Guild, Mage College, Dark Brotherhood and the Companions * The Blades/Greybeards (again, depending on the chosen side) Also, in Round 1, Courier 6 has whatever he carried with him to Hoover Dam, and the Dragonborn has access to ALL shouts, spells, ect.

Info Dump: Pokemon Emerald intro stuff 2013-12-15 23:51:14 reddit post Hey all, I'm working through the Emerald intro step-by-step so that I can get rid of the events like the moving truck, the starter Pokemon event, ect. I decided to make a post as a place to store all the info I've gathered; my goal is to eliminate all the intro cutscenes, starting with Mom welcoming you to your new home and ending with Wally's Pokemon catching tutorial. Downvote, upvote, I don't care, but mods, please don't delete this post. It's really more of a way for me to store info without using my horribly organized computer file system. I will do it by editing as I go along, so it won't begin with much info at all. * checkgender gives 0x1 for girl, 0x0 for boy * "setvar 0x4092 0x6" says that you've already set your clock * 0x4092 seems to be the controlling variable for the mother's responses. 0x7 indicates that you entered the house, but not your room yet * "clearflag 0x2F8" causes a rival sprite of the wrong gender to appear in your doorway in your room. * * "setvar 0x408D 0x3" causes the rival's Pokeball to trigger a message ("This is [rival]'s pokeball"). If this command is not executed, the rival's Pokeball will trigger the entrance of the rival and that little intro. * * "setvar 0x4050 0x1" causes the little girl who stops you from leaving to move, and allows you to go onto route 101 to trigger the starter pokemon event. * * "setflag 0x331" does nothing I can determine yet. * * I can't find the code for Mom talking about Dad on the TV * 0x8004 is the mother * I can't find the code for rival's mom talking when you enter her house * On the littleroot map, the header that "Validates values 0x2", deleting lines 8-9, 19-38 and 41-43 will remove the opening cutscene. These lines begin, respectively, with "warpmuted 0x1 0x0 0xFF 0x8 0x8", "setdooropened 0x8004 0x8005" and "spriteinvisible 0xFF 0x0 0x0" * I need to stop mom's talk when I enter the house, stop mom's tv talk, stop rival mom's talk when I enter her house. * * setflag 0x74 makes the guy blocking the route out of Oldale move * I'm having some weird formatting bugs, so things might get a bit messed up.

According to the talk, Russia's military could field more men but was less organized and less industrialized than the other European land powers (Germany and France). What if Germany's plan for war involved not first attacking France through Belgium, but attacking Russia and crushing them before they got their act together? Would Germany have succeeded? Would England ever join the War? America? And on which side?

The Roman Imperial Army, under Augustus, contained 25 legions of about 5,000 men each, amounting to a total of 125,000 men. This army mostly consisted of heavy infantry. It also included 250 auxilia of 500 men each, composed of cavalry, archers, slingers and some heavy infantry. So 150,000 Napoleonic troops under Napoleon vs 250,000 Roman troops under Scipio. Edit: Scipio understands the implications of gunpowder warfare, but Romans cannot operate such weapons.

For about 12 years now, another patrician has been Prince-Mayor. All of a sudden, my trade post in Ormond disappears. No message, it just vanishes from the Republic screen. I checked Ormond itself, and yes, my post was gone. I thought it was a one-time bug, so I shelled out the cash to build a new one and continued playing. Now, a few years after that, my trade post in Ormond has once again disappeared. Any fixes? Explainations? Thanks. I just beat level 9 of Block Dude 2013-09-18 03:34:04 reddit post Fuck. Yes.

The girl I used to fancy has fallen out of my favor, I've overplayed my scenarios of wealth, and I'm pretty much completely out of things to think about.

WHAT THE SERIOUS FUCK, Italians and Frenchmen spend HALF THEIR WAKING HOURS EATING. EATING. I love food, but what the fuck? Back home, we finish every meal in less than an hour. And the power outlets suck, everything you plug in keeps falling out because the sockets are too wide for the plugs. There's no AC anywhere in Italy. Germans are cool, but WHY THE FUCK DO THEY WANT TO KEEP THESE FUCKING SOCIALIST MONEY-BURNERS IN THE EU? "Oh, we should help our Italian and Greek friends, we're all fellow Europeans." THEY TAKE SIESTAS WHILE YOU WORK OVERTIME. America's in bad shape right now, but Europe is worse. America would not stand for this "bail out every deadbeat on the continent" shit. Americans have a work-play balance. We work because we're ambitious, we want better for ourselves. It's a constant struggle to get ahead. And you know what? I LOVE IT. Competition drives progress. At the end of the day, would you rather work hard and be proud of yourself, or lounge around all day and feel completely unfulfilled, not to mention FUCKING BROKE. Thank God for The UK though. My little slice of America in Europe. They speak English, understand hard work and the purpose of it, and the plugs ACTUALLY FUCKING STAY IN THE WALL. I'm a week into this trip and I cannot wait to get home. I miss my friends. I miss Netflix. I miss working for a purpose and relaxing with comfortable fulfillment. Our gas is cheaper, our food is cheaper, and our people take an active intrest in something other than the family trade.

The professors give you a Pokedex to try to get a good understanding of the Pokemon that other professors and independent researchers have created. And the reason you have to defeat the 8 gym leaders and the Elite Four? The professor wants to know how good the Pokemon they created is. To tie this into my apocalypse theory, the Professors are the remnants of the pre-war research group that created the Pokemon that killed so many people. Professors want to create even stronger Pokemon, to topple the current regime of the Elite Four/Gym Leaders and install a different government. And Team Rocket could be the pre-war military. Just a random thought. Level Editor help? 2013-06-02 02:39:31 reddit post I'm having some trouble with the level editor, and I need some help. 1. I can't figure out the patrol commands. 2. Wiring makes no sense, I can't get the alarms to go off. 3. Is there a way to add a floor below the ground floor? EDIT: Fixed number 1, I used trap wiring. EDIT: Fixed everything, except #2 which seems so be unfixable. Thanks! EDIT 3: I still have no idea what the rest of the patrol commands mean. I'm starting to look into colleges, and I would like one with a good MUN program. Any suggestions? 2013-06-01 02:54:58 reddit post The only other requirement is that it has to have a solid CS department. I looked at BU, but it seems to be primarily about Law, Music and Business. Any help? All the Teams in the world used to be united. 2013-05-31 22:33:13 reddit post So once upon a time there was Team Rocket. It was a powerful organization that lead hundreds of loyal trainers. When the war, referenced by Lt. Surge, occurred, Team Rocket was on the losing side. Top leaders in Team Rocket were defeated by Gym Leaders and the Elite Four, and the organization fractured. They split up, and over time the different local branches took on their own names and identities. Branded war criminals, they dissolved into organized crime, trying to bring down the Elite Four and establish their own rule under the new Team, with their own principles. Team Rocket today exists as the higher leadership of the original team, and is loyal to it's original goal: To protect the world from devastation To unite all people with in our nations To denounce the evil of truth and love To extend our reach to the stars above They act to take over Kanto and Jhoto, while oblivious to the distortion of their original goals in other regions. Why do trainers, even openly hostile ones, give you money upon victory? 2013-05-30 23:55:46 reddit post Because they have to. Otherwise your Pokemon will attack, injure and perhaps kill them. Pokemon are fantastic creatures, capable of destroying entire towns sometimes. Wouldn't you feel threatened if someone else stood in front of you, with a powerful creature at their command, while you had none? A team Rocket member might hate you, but if he think's you're mugging him he'll throw you his wallet quick. This also answers why there is such a different progression of technology in the Pokemon world. They have trains, cars, boats, televisions, lighting and much more. But where are the weapons? Why does no one carry a gun in self defense? There are no guns, tanks, or bombers because such items would be very ineffective against a purely Pokemon army. Got a tank? We'll drown it with surf, it doesn't work anymore. A handgun? That's OK, plenty of Pokemon are so hard-skinned that bullets will bounce off. So nobody is going to bother with a self-defense technique that doesn't involve Pokemon.

When John Dickinson resigned from the Continental Congress in 1776, who replaced him? 2013-05-15 19:54:43 reddit post I've had a lot of trouble finding an answer on this subject. I know it isn't a very thought provoking or discussion provoking question, but I thought this would be the place to ask. Thanks in advance. I just realized that pistols are not available as a weapon to the player 2013-05-10 23:05:44 reddit post All the weapons used by enemies in the game are available as tools to the player(s). Gendarme shotguns, Agent submachine guns, watchmen wrenches. But cops have pistols, which are not available to player. Do you think this might be patched in? Perhaps as a new weapon, perhaps as a new character's special ability? Plagiarism question 2013-05-10 00:46:48 reddit post Bishop Ireton MUN this year is a few crisis committees dealing withe American Revolution. I will be John Dickinson in the Continental Congress.

Again, I would be using only his words and none of my own. When is the level editor supposed to come out? 2013-05-08 03:57:35 reddit post Just finished Identity, all cleaned out.

How does /r/MUN feel about a Venture Crew rather than a school participating? North Korea 2013-04-19 03:38:40 reddit post The Treaty of Versailles awarded the Shandong Peninsula to Japan after WWI. It was previously owned by Germany. Now the United States had promised China that if they joined in WWI against Germany, China would receive the Shandong Peninsula. During the creation of the treaty, President Wilson tried and failed to give the region to China, and it was given instead to Japan. Many Chinese felt betrayed by the USA, and China's relations with the country suffered. Many people in China grew attached to the Russian idea of Communism, and this resulted in the Chinese Civil War in 1927. When it was resolved finally in 1949, China was a communist state. Thus, the Treaty of Versailles resulted in Chinese Communism. Now after World War Two, Korea was administered half by Russia and half by the United States. In 1948, North Korea and South Korea were established as independent nations. The Korean War broke out in 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea. The NK forces pushed back the South Koreans to the very tip of the peninsula, when the USA arrived. Their intervention pushed the North Korean forces back to the border and then some, invading North Korea and taking territory for the South. Enter China. China intervened and fought the US-SK forces to a stalemate. The Armistice was signed, and North Korea and South Korea both remained. But if China was not communist, and was a capitalist nation like their former friend America, would they have supported North Korea? No. If NK forces did invade, the entire Korean Peninsula would have been united by American Military force and Communist Korea would be no more. Thus, North Korea, and all problems resulting from it, is the fault of the Treaty of Versailles.

They can handle themselves in melee, and their crossbows are deadly. A new kind of battle 2013-04-01 23:20:05 reddit post The streets of /r/Hardboiled were empty as I walked along them, on that chilly, wet night. Light drops of rain fell on my tattered trenchcoat. There were things on my mind, things I just couldn't figure out. Some new subs sprang up overnight, and they were the talk of reddit. /r/Periwinkle and /r/Orangered. What were they for? Every redditor was called into /r/blog, branded with the mark of their team. I could still feel the burning sting of that brand. I pulled up my sleeve to look at it. A small orange circle on my forearm. A sickening joke those mysterious mods at /r/blog pulled. The brands weren't all we got. They gave us... things. Hats usually, but sometimes we got other items, strange, unusual items. A scimitar, a tacky golden wand. We were told, forced even, to do battle with the other side. It was brother against brother, father against son. The bloodshed had no meaning that was apparent to me, but I knew there had to be some meaning to this. Instantly many redditors developed a fervent loyalty to their assigned color. Orangered, my supposed "comrades" flooded my front page with their silly propoganda. Every moment, my mailbox was bombarded by posts of oranges, of mail, of upvotes. It was a get-karma-quick scheme for many. I just wanted to know what was behind all of it. I spotted another man walking the streets in front of me. My hand went to my hip, feeling the cool handle of my revolver. Hardboiled was dangerous enough as-is, but with this civil war going on any man could shoot me on sight for my color. He hadn't noticed me yet. He was walking slowly, his trenchcoat and fedora protecting him from the worst of the rain. I walked quietly towards him, until I was but ten feet away. He faced away from me, not noticing, and removed a cigarette from his pocket. "Rough night, huh?" I said, pulling my lighter from my pocket, but keeping my gun close at hand, "Need a light?"

How does the rest of US history play out? An innocent refugee. 2013-03-17 05:46:23 reddit post "He is dead." I wasn't sure I heard the words properly, so I asked again, "May I speak with RedditNoir, please?" "I told you, he died. Shot by one of karmanaut's thugs. Is there anything else you needed?" I hung up the phone, numb with shock. RedditNoir. Dead. How could this be? "Alright, [deleted], that was that. Now lets get you to KarmaCourt." I glared at him, the vile man. NotaMethAddict. The Justice who would preside over my case. Not that there was anything just about him. He dragged me away, ripping the phone from my hands. He takes those hands and roughly shoves them behind my back, binding them with a pair of rusty handcuffs. Laughing, he pushes me through the halls towards the courtroom. I remember when KarmaCourt was just. A court of law where reposters and douchebags were punished according to the law. Now it is a hell-hole. A joke. I was arrested on trumped-up charges of "douchbaggery" because I won an argument with one of the Justices. My reminiscing is interrupted as NotaMethAddict hands me over to a bailiff. "Here's the douche, [deleted]. Take him to be judged." A muffled voice replied, "Sure thing, justice NotaMethAddict." My ears perked up at the sound of his voice. Could it be? His hat was worn low, covering his face with a shadow. He grabbed my shoulders and gave me a slight push down the hall. I stared at the guard. I felt uncertain, but I suspected him to be a friend. I began to lose hope, however, as we turned a corner and headed straight for the courtroom. My heart sunk, I felt a deep despair. But he took an unexpected left, into an empty room. The guard quickly locked the door behind him and whipped off his hat. "MarcusFlarcus!" I exclaimed. He shot me a look. "Keep your voice down! I'm going to get you out of here." He stepped to the back of the room and removed a small parcel. "Put this on," MarcusFlarcus said. I opened the package to see a guard uniform. I quickly put it on, as MarcusFlarcus watches through the window to see if anyone is coming. Once I finish, he hands me a small object wrapped in a handkerchief. "What's this?" I ask. I know the answer, and I dread it, but I must be sure. "You're weapon," replies my friend. "Smith Wesson 36. Holds 5 shots. Won't do too much damage, but it was the best I could get my hands on." He looks nervously out the window. "What's the plan?" I ask. MarcusFlarcus gives me a nervous grin. "Act discreet, then run like hell." Opening the door of the small room we begin to walk down the corridor. Stepping quickly, we head for the exit. It almost looks like we are going to get away, but we round a corner and bump into a short man with his head buried in a stack of case files. He mumbles a "sorry," but stops short when he sees us. "Say... I haven't seen you fellas around here before." MarcusFlarcus and I mutter something about being new, and try to push past him. He doesn't budge. "Are you sure you're real guards?" Marcus looks at him and says, "Look, we are on really important business right now. Could you just save the interrogation for later?" But the little man just stands there. "I think I'm going to have to ask you to-" He never finishes. As his body falls to the floor, I stare in horror at MarcusFlarcus's gun. It still smokes with the powder that killed a man. "Marcus-" "No time, [deleted]! We gotta get out of here." We run through the halls at a breakneck pace. One more corner and we see the exit, not fifty feet away. We make a mad dash for it, but MarcusFlarcus cries out only ten feet from the door. He falls to his knees. I see the culprit: A guard with a still smoking gun. I run back to my friend, taking my revolver from my pocket. Another shot. This one aimed at me. I point my gun at the guard and pull the trigger. He falls into a pool of his own blood. I return to my friend. MarcusFlarcus is out cold, maybe dead. I lift Marcus up and sling him across my back. I run into the parking lot as quickly as I can and jump into the first car I see. A sleek red convertible. I load Marcus into the backseat and hop into the front. I still remember a few tricks from my mob days, and the car is hotwired in short order. I floor the pedal, driving off through the streets away from KarmaCourt. After a few miles of driving, I pull off into an alley. My attention then turns to my injured friend. "MarcusFlarcus!" I shout. I slap him on the face to wake him up. He does not jerk awake, but slowly comes to. "[deleted]...," he says, "I won't live through this..." I try to protest but he stops me. "[deleted], take care of yourself. I want you to have this." He removes from his pocket a stack of papers. "A new identity, [deleted]. A new life. Go find a small sub to hide out in for a while, and then..." He gives me a smile as he breathes his last, "You are free." I drive for hours. In a secluded spot I pull over and give my friend a burial. I would have been there for a while if there hadn't been a shovel in the trunk. Once he is good and buried, I drive away. Darkness falls. I drive past a little sign that says "Welcome to Hardboiled". The car pulls up on an empty street and I look for a place to stay. I cruise slowly through the abandoned town and soon I spot a little place with a neon sign hanging over it that reads, "Blueboy Inn". I stop the car and get out. I don't care about the thing anymore, and I reckon it's impossible to keep something that flashy safe in a place like this. Stepping into the place, I can tell immediately that it's a seedy affair. Cloth covers up smashed windows, a few gruff-looking men whisper over their brandy. I approach the bartender. "I'd like to spend the night." He eyes me suspiciously. "Rooms are all full. Find another place." I sigh tiredly. "Thank you," I say. Manners never hurt. I fell a tap on my shoulder. "Hey, fella. If you're looking for a place to stay, you can come to my place. I got an extra bed." What a relief. "How much?" I ask. The man laughs. "Oh, it won't cost you a dime. Just trying to help a stranger out." We walk to his house. By the time I got out of the inn, the car was gone. I had expected as much. We approach his door and he asks me, "Say, what's your name anyhow?" I almost say my old name. But that's [deleted] now. I glance at the papers that Marcus handed me. ID's, passports, driver's licence, all with my face, and all with the same name. "I'm subject1637," I say. "And you are?"

I think it was a precursor to what would happen later on but I still kept smoking. Basically I have depression and a family history with mental problems. My mom told me when she smoked weed she had a total freak out. Same with one of my relatives. Anyways I knew smoking while depressed can either help or hinder but I was stupid. I smoked every day after school and all of a sudden I just became detached from my body. I don't feel like I'm "living" anymore. I feel like I'm not physically present and I'm just watching myself from the outside. I'm so stupid because I continue to use marijuana and each time I'm high I have a scary out of body experience which worsens how I am sober. When I'm high and think "this is happening. This is real." I start to panic and freak out. My mind is so fucked up and I can't physically feel anything anymore or remember most things. I've honestly ruined my life by smoking weed and wish i had never started. I haven't smoked in almost a month because I'm too scared. Is there anyone else who has had an experience similar to this? 2015-11-16 01:38:39 reddit post There's a cute lil heart shaped pepperoni on the bottom right corner.

With girls I think that it's important that we establish that we have a life, are cute and are interesting.

And it does really suppress my appetite, I've been able to restrict so much better now that I'm on it. Random question, when you started it, did you get really bad brain zaps? Mine were horrible and I'm still getting some mild ones 3 weeks later. So I'm thinking that my restriction might be making those side effects much more intense. 2015-11-30 15:28:30 reddit post I wish I could bake and not eat it.

That's less then what most consider a meal. You should just go back to your routine tomorrow and it will make up for this. This is just a tiny little blip in the grand scheme of things. One bad day won't make you gain weight, just like 1 good day won't make you lose weight. I don't know much about EC stacks, so I can't say anything about that. But laxatives won't make you lose any real weight, it will just dehydrate you and you might get addicted to them, which would really suck! 2015-11-30 04:26:58 reddit post Really? There's a group?

I think most people find slightly underweight girls attractive but once you get too low people stop finding it attractive. Probably a big part of why people find underweight girls attractive is because of the media and advertising, most actresses and models are underweight or very near it. 2015-11-29 04:32:14 reddit post I love the food network!!!

I guess I just needed to get some stuff out sorry about that lol 2015-04-23 06:48:47 reddit post Thank you for the advice yes I suspect depression. I tryed therapy about a year ago and was diagnosed with anorexia and bipolar type 2, but she really didn't help me. looking back on it I think it made things worse, the therapist I saw kind of ignored the issues that I was actually ready to deal with, and as soon as I came in she said she thought I was bipolar. The psychiatrist she sent me too was her friend from highschool, or something, and she immediately perscibed me medication for bipolar disorder type 2, without even talking to me. The whole thing made me feel like my own opinion and self awareness was unimportant. Wow way more rant-ish than I intended sorry I guess I just want some opinions on all this bull shit. I wish I was just fucking normal. Help 2015-04-23 05:03:24 reddit post I dont want to do anything anymore.

And now I have this nagging part of me that says that I shouldn't be allowed medication, because im just going to use it for weight loss. I'm not trying to use it in this way, and I know that.

subject8657 Request: What are some steps that I can take to control my compulsion to B P? 2014-11-13 18:27:25 reddit post I am currently overweight, and I have been most of my life, but I've made a lot of progress this year, coming from being well into morbidly obese. I do a good job of eating exercising, and I lose at a healthy rate. I get a little overwhelmed by restricting calories, but I don't think I need help for that. When I have cheat days, I easily eat back that entire week's deficit. I purge it all by vomiting, but I know that doesn't really get rid of it. I figure I can continue eating. I have been feeling for so long that this is fine, because it's only once a month, as opposed to more than ten times a day like I was doing before I got on track. But yesterday I genuinely set out to eat moderately for a cheat day, but I found myself compulsively buying more junk food than I actually even wanted, and purging all of it. I felt like I didn't even have a choice. I have a therapist, and I know she's not the most productive one around, but I'm currently in crisis with depression and anxiety and it's really not a good time to go shopping. I might go on Prozac soon, and I need to at least have someone familiar to see every week while I'm adjusting. I think I'll look for someone new if I get through all of this without a hospitalization. But for now, I'd like to know if anyone has any advice for how to talk to her, and what I could expect in return. I don't think I'll ever fully recover, but I want to take steps to feeling more in control and more capable of making the decision not to B P. Has anyone successfully come back from a very compulsive habit? What were the first things you did to break the cycle? I am motivated to push myself, but that's offset by my low expectations that I'll ever be normative with food. I really want to just focus on not doing what I'm doing anymore. I want to be able to eat off-program every few weeks without binging. And I hate, hate, hate purging so much. It feels like death. How do I do this, with my therapist's help? Request: How to stop the nosedive that my relapse is taking 2014-11-13 05:59:12 reddit post Hey, I've (19/m) been diagnosed with Anorexia for 4.5 years now, and it's been about two years since I sort of recovered-but-didn't-really from when I was at my worst, so to speak. Came out of hospital, vowed to never let it happen again (.. sort of) and maintained a not really super high weight. I mean all I really felt like I did was maintain my weight enough so I would lose all attention from doctors and such, which worked, but it didn't really solve anything, just stick it in the background. So now, two years later I've started at a new college and completely relapsed. I've had bouts where I have relapsed but it's never been this bad/lasted this long so far. I think what kind of sparked it is: being surrounded by all these new people and struggling to make friends in the first two weeks by feeling like a complete outsider confirmed my feeling of a lack of identity. So I went back to something I knew, and that could stand in for it - except this time the mentality is not as clear cut and it just makes everything feel so much awful as I'm objectively aware of what's at risk now compared to the last time. So now I'm here (if any of that even made sense), right on the verge of wrecking everything I worked for in the past two years and I just.. don't care. I should, but I don't, and I'm at a loss (so is my therapist..) It's like I faked my way through the past two years without actually solving anything at all (something that my therapist can't seem to understand when I try to be honest) Erm, to finish (wow this seems long) - does anyone have any.. I don't know, advice? I guess, on where to go from here (where I'm pretty much alone support wise. Well, I have my therapist but he's .. well, he can shove it sometimes). Request: help with an out of town friend 2014-11-12 16:07:18 reddit post We are a small group of friends and one girl moved away a couple of years ago to a city 5+ hours away. Independently, three of us have noticed signals pointing to an eating disorder, ranging from downy body hair a period of time ago, an obsession with food, and recently, very restricted eating on the few occasions we have eaten together, but because we only see her occasionally, it is hard to tell if she has an eating disorder. Three of us are going to visit in a few weeks, and would like some advice on how to proceed if we keep noticing signs, or what else we should look for. We will be staying at her place. We don't know her friends in the new city, and have only briefly met her new boyfriend. We are comfortable speaking to her parents or brother wife, who live in the same city as us and we know them well. They see her more often than we do. Tldr; friend lives in another city and we suspect an eating disorder. What should we do on an upcoming visit to either find out more or what should we do if we get enough confirmation to be very concerned? Request: Does anyone work in the health field? 2014-11-12 05:01:35 reddit post I'm not sure of the demographics of our subreddit but I was curious to see if anyone works in the health field? Nursing? Community Health? Nutrition? Mental Health? I am about to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Nutrition degree with a concentration in Dietetics. My route would be to become a Registered Dietician. To sum up a lifetime of information in a short sentence, the decision to be a RD (registered dietician) was made at a different time in my life. I thought I was....better. I feel deflated. I wanted to become a RD when I was more "recovered". I thought I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE FEEL BETTER! OMG FOOD IS AWESOME AND EVERYONE SHOULD FEEL THIS HEALTHY! OMG RAINBOWS AND SUNSHINE AND UNICORNS AND AVOCADOS! Now I have a dark cloud over me. I think I eat pretty well? I still restrict...but I don't know. My mind is all over the place. I'm burnt out from school and everything that has to do with food. I have thought about food for the past decade because of my eating disorder. Now I have academically studied food/nutrition/health/physiology day in and day out for the past 3 years. Straight A's. Study study study. Now I feel like my restricting patterns are covered and intertwined with piles of justifications and reasons I feed myself. The worst part is, I don't feel like helping people anymore in that way. Mostly because no one really cares WHY they should eat healthy. They just want me to tell them the easiest way to lose weight. I'm rambling. Does anyone work in the health field?

I posted on this subreddit over the summer, and didn't get much feedback, but I'm hoping for more guidance this time. My boyfriend gave me an ultimatum this summer to see a doctor about my bad body image and eating thoughts. I went to the doctor and got told I had BDD, and "disordered eating" leaning on the side of EDNOS. They told me to take a day off of work each week (I work 7 days a week) but I can't afford that and they prescribed me meds. I took them for a while but really didn't think they were helping. Lately the thoughts are worse than ever before. This all started while I was on a weight loss journey, which kind of became an obsession. I injured myself overdoing it with the exercise (I ran a half marathon, then went back to work, worked out during the week and then ran a 5k in the rain that weekend) and I was just on a work trip - which means largely unhealthy eating - and I've not only stalled in my weight loss, but I've gained. It's the gain and the fear of gain that's impacting me. I'm petrified to wake up and see that my double chin's come back. I'm tired of being overweight. But now...on to why I'm posting. While I had thought about throwing up and starving, I had never acted upon it until now. It happened during my work trip. I was eating with a group at a Mexican restaurant there, and I overdid it. I basically binged. And had a margarita - a strong one. During my tipsy state I made myself throw up, but didn't push it too much. I told my boyfriend and he's terrified. I've thought about doing it again, but haven't acted upon it. I've even considering exercising with my injury against doctors orders, so I don't gain weight. Work's been a million times stressful lately and I've been stress eating and binging as well. What do I do? How do I get back on track? How do I keep myself from wanting to throw up? Request: Anxiety, depression, bulimia, and saying the wrong thing to my ex, nipping BN before it gets worse. 2014-11-10 04:28:02 reddit post I have anxiety, depression, and bulimia. I'm a guy. Four years ago I met my (now ex) gf and she had bulimia. I loved her so much, I still do. She said I helped her get better just by loving her. We broke up after three years and the last thing I said to her was the nastiest thing I ever said to anyone, and about her bulimia. That comment was not me, and it sent me spiraling down into a sea of anxiety of depression. I want to tell her I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. She is happy now and that's great. I've always been underweight and I would eat and eat to gain weight but it is hard gaining weight for me. One day a few weeks ago I found myself sick to the stomach and needed to get rid of the feeling. So I did. Ever since I've been binging and purging. I'm not sure if it's karma or what. I think about that comment all the time. We had such a good relationship and her last memory of me is an evil one. I have suicidal thoughts and daydream about dying. I love her so much and I wish she would know how much she means to me. It's been like a month and I need to stop this before it get's worse. I don't know what to do, where to start. I'm alone and hide all day. I want to drop out of school. Idk what to do. How do I tell her I'm sorry? How do I get out of bulimia? Request: Vyvanse for BED/Binge Purge: Anyone With Experience? 2014-11-08 00:25:41 reddit post I've struggled with B/P and BED for several years, tried lots of therapists, meditation, hypnotherapy, anti depressants, clonazepam for anxiety. etc. and have done better or worse depending on whats going on in my life but have never really been able to complete recover. I started researching drugs for Bulimia and BED and other than anti-depressants there is nothing FDA approved. Since I've tried those and they didn't work, and they can make you gain weight, I didn't want to try those again. I considered Topimax, but I have a girl friend on it and she told me of horrible side effects and having a hard time focusing. Not really an option for me since I need to be on point for work. Anyways, I came across a few studies on Vyvanse, an ADHD drug, that is trying to get FDA approval right now for BED. I talked to my doctor about it, she had never heard of it being used for ED so she researched it and agreed to try it on one condition. She said I had to promise no purging (vomit type not exercise) as vomiting could give me seizures, which is why it was tested on BED and not bulimics. Well seizures are pretty scary... enough to get me on-board with no purging and knowing if I don't binge then I don't purge. She started me on 20 mg/day for the first week and then moved me to 40 mg. Its been 3 weeks and I haven't had one binging episode yet!!!! This is the longest I've gone in...well... forever it seems. So my question to the group. There isn't a lot of information on how to use Vyvanse... I'm curious if anyone else has tried it? If so, how long did you take it for? Did you try stopping it and if so did your binging come back? Do you take it every day? My hope is Vyvanse will be enough to break the "habit" part of my ED while my therapy works on the emotional part. Request: Roommate concern, bulimia 2014-11-07 23:06:03 reddit post My roommate is a friend from work and we started living together 2 months ago. I have noticed she throws up her food but does things like leave the toilet seat up, almost to be obvious, I dont know. I have been ignoring it.

It is upsetting because I do care for her, but I dont know how much to get into her business. Do i continue to ignore? Please help. Request: Quitting Calorie Counting/Exchanges/Measuring Food Cold Turkey...good idea? Ways to manage anxiety, intuitive eating, etc? 2014-11-07 20:00:23 reddit post Long story short, I've been recovered from AN for some time and am at a healthy weight. However, for the longest time, I still used a food scale religiously and kept a food journal/app (flipped between a few methods). As of late due to stress and the fact that I am still at this whole religious tracking, I've had issues binging off an on for the past few months. Last nights basically occurred because I wanted a healthy food item, was hungry for 2, but only had "allowance" for one. I ate one serving...then another...then broke out some other food and went at it. It hit me right after it happened. I now binge off and on when anything is off limits. I also binge when I figure out what I'm eating for the next meal (really bad at night trying to figure out what to eat for breakfast). So...as I'm writing this, I literally just threw out my food scale(...s-yes its sad). I now know that I'm going to be anxious pretty much 24/7 for the next few weeks, but I tried weening off of counting in the past and it never worked. The second I got stressed I'd regress..I'm kind of an all or nothing person, so I'm going to try it this way. Any tips on how to manage anxiety? Intuitive eating? Making sure I'm still doing okay health wise (I just weigh myself 1x a week)? 2014-11-06 14:43:18 reddit post Possibly helpful posts: [Helping gf](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1pl03w/sharing_girlfriend_is_recovering_from_bulimia/) [What not to say](http://www.anad.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/What-Not-To-Say.pdf) [Helping gf #2](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/2ajwpb/sharing_some_of_my_personal_experince_on_how_to/) [Help gf](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1y5gup/request_how_to_help_my_gf/) 2014-11-06 14:30:43 reddit post Hopefully helpful posts: [Helping gf](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1pl03w/sharing_girlfriend_is_recovering_from_bulimia/) [What not to say](http://www.anad.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/What-Not-To-Say.pdf) [Helping gf #2](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/2ajwpb/sharing_some_of_my_personal_experince_on_how_to/) [Help gf](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1y5gup/request_how_to_help_my_gf/) Request: Request for advice on how to talk to roommate/best friend about recent habits? 2014-11-06 12:40:07 reddit post My friend, who in recent months has become my roommate, struggles with an ED. Before moving in together, we talked very often but of course I could only know what she told me over the phone. Although she never specifically told me that she has an ED, she has often talked about her food issues and stress surrounding them, and although I am not sure how to describe it, but it is very clear between the two of us that I am aware of it. However, despite me knowing about her issues and being highly concerned for her well being all the time, I know it is not my place to comment on her habits or to tell her what to do in anyway. This is mostly due to the fact that I know her mother is not supportive of the notion of her having any kind of issue, and often will stress her out by forcing her into eating, and that she also regularly would see a therapist, although honestly I have my doubts about her mentioning anything food related to her. During this time I knew not to be the person to bring anything related up, as again, she has enough people doing that and I am her friend, not her therapist and I do not want to become another source of stress to her or have her distrust me in anyway. She has made it very clear that she does not wish to talk about it. Coming to now, however, I am concerned enough to want to break my silence. As Ive said, we now live together and spend a large percentage of our time together. For a while she was doing great, without her mother there to stress her out and without anything else stressful in her life it was ok. Recently though this has changed, and I have picked up that she had not been eating well for a couple of days, and now I am certain that besides an unnatural amount of water she has not eaten anything in more than a couple of days. I am at a loss for what to do, as I know that I cannot make her do anything, but I dont know if it is smarter or safer to her health for me to tell her my observations or not to. On one hand I dont want her to continue this of course, because she is very obviously not feeling well and I am scared for anything more serious happening to her because of this, but on the other I do not want to break her trust or cause her to become anymore stressed out due by me talking to her. Im just at a total loss for what to do or say reddit, I just want her to be ok again ): Request: Think girl I am dating has an ED. If so, ow do I approach her about it? 2014-11-06 06:14:12 reddit post I've recently started dating this girl who I am pretty into, and things seem to be getting serious. Her eating habits do concern me though and I'm looking to find out if she does in fact have an ED, and how I should approach her about my concerns. For starters, she does have celiac, which she was diagnosed with about a year ago; she also chooses to be vegetarian. Because of these two things she is obviously very limited in what she can eat. She is not visibly underweight to the point where its noticeable in everyday interaction, but from the chart in the side-bar, and judging by what shes told me her height/weight are, she definitely may be underweight. She admits to not eating much at all and says that she is tired of the foods she is able to eat; when I asked her what she enjoys she says she eats marshmallows and chocolate chips and drinks a lot of lattes/Espresso. I have hung out with her about 5 times, some of which were for 8+ hours and during that time she has only drank coffee/water. I've had to eat multiple times during these times to keep from getting HANGRY, as I put it. She has also told me that she ate a specific number of calories for a period of time that I know to be well below what is healthy; she says she did this because friend told her it was okay/healthy. Do you guys think she has an ED judging from this info? How do I bring it up without hurting/offending her? I take my personal health really seriously, and even though I haven't known her long it is difficult to see someone seem to be so uninterested in/struggle with food. Thanks in advance guys. Started recovery and noticing pains in my body. What should I do? 2014-11-05 11:28:43 reddit post I've been bulimic for 8 years and a month into my recovery. After looking through some of the medical effects of bulimia, I've only just started to realise that the pains I've been having are likely to be related to my eating disorder. I get very severe stomach pains I can barely talk through and used to, very naively, blame it on hunger pains or too much food. I've recently started to have chest pains as well which got quite bad last night. I'm not 100% sure this is due to my bulimia but now I'm getting worried. I've read so many stories of the problems people have had because of their disorder and not sure what step I should take now. I'm away from home and not registered which any doctors in my area. I have tried calling the local doctors but they say that they're full. I was considering going to A E (emergency room) but how urgent do you think this is? I feel like I'm overreacting slightly and not sure what tests they can actually do or whether they'd do anything once I'm there. There is also the choice of calling the NHS helpline but it's expensive and not sure how much they'll be able to help. Survey: Anonymous ED survey, Chance to share your story if you'd like 2014-11-05 05:46:08 reddit post I would like to collect anonymous feedback from other eating disorder sufferers for a presentation I am doing on EDs in my college Psychology course. I have set up a survey online which keeps all submissions anonymous (to me, and thus to everyone else), in the hope that I can shed light on the individual struggle. I want to keep my presentation from being clinical and impersonal while still respecting the privacy rights of sufferers.

Request: Advice on helping girlfriend with EDNOS 2014-11-05 03:08:13 reddit post First, thank you to anyone for your time and comments on this thread. Secondly, please forgive me if in my attempt to speak knowledgably, I use any wrong wording or misinformation. Im here for help and not to offend anyone. My girlfriend and I have a fantastic relationship. Theres not a thing about her I would change, except, this one thing. Shes struggled with binge eating and purging for a long time now. This all pre-dates our relationship. Earlier in our relationship, I addressed it. It was obvious that she was sneaking off after meals. Sometimes, Id find the underside of the toilette seat to have stained or still wet vomit. We had a very open, though hard conversation about her addiction. Shes gone through therapy and has done a 30 day inpatient rehab. Shes explained to me that her addition is not fueled by a body image issue, but rather its a control issue. Also, weve talked about the sugar rushes she experiences from carbs and junk food and enjoying that feeling. Im not certain, but I believe shes bingeing and purging about every 4-5 days. I know that I cant be her white knight. I cant fix this for her. Ive dated a person with an eating disorder before, and its a hard battle. And its a battle that cant be fought by anyone other than the person suffering. Im having a hard time with it, because while shes open to talking to me when I have questions, its an incredibly hard conversation to start. I know shes ashamed and embarrassed by it, so having starting a conversation about not wanting to be finding vomit stained toilets anymore is difficult. I know I cant fix this, but I can support her with every fiber of my body. Im looking for any advice for being in a relationship with a person thats suffering; if there are any communication tips, things to say and not say. I dont want to make her uncomfortable or make her feel bad. Shes stopped going to therapy within the last 3 months, and I feel like maybe she needs to keep trying. How do I suggest that? Again, thank you all for your comments/advice. 2014-11-04 16:32:01 reddit post Some centers that offer this - we know nothing more than what is on their websites about these programs: [Indiana](http://selahhouse.com/Programs/AdultTreatment/EquineTherapy) [Arizona](http://www.remudaranch.com/about/types-of-therapy/eagala-model) [Arizona](http://rosewoodranch.com/) [Washington](http://unbridledcounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Equine-Assisted-Therapy-Flyer1.pdf) [Florida -Christian based](http://www.canopycove.com/equine-therapy) [California](http://www.anxietytreatmentexperts.com/equine-assisted-therapy/) Search your area and you should be able to find some sort of equine therapy available near you. Equine Therapy for Eating Disorders 2014-11-04 15:57:27 reddit post Request: Remembering that I'm a binge eater.. 2014-11-03 12:00:27 reddit post I know I have BED, and I have had for the past couple of years now. The past few months have been quite good, in that I have discovered a way that works for me in getting over the disorder, and whilst I still have a way to go in overcoming it completely, I've definitely made progress. My question is about reminding myself about it. For example, when I haven't binged in about a month or so, I feel so great and happy and back to my normal self that I forget I have this unhealthy relationship with food, and allow myself to eat something I wouldn't normally. This is the trigger, and it then happens all over again. When I'm feeling so good, and I try to remind myself that I'm a recovering binger, I don't believe myself. I become schizophrenic and talk myself out of the fact that I need to be careful with food. But once I have that bad food which I know I shouldn't, I go on a 2 day binge and make myself completely sick and hate myself for it. only THEN do I remember, and believe the rational me, that I am a recovering food addict. How do you guys remind yourself after extended periods of time NOT to have that food in case it starts another vicious cycle? When you've come such a long way and it feels like that part of your past never existed, how do you remind yourself that it did, and that it'll never be the same for you as it is with other people who haven't suffered the disorder?? Request: Do I have an eating disorder, anorexia, or just bad habits? 2014-11-03 05:05:41 reddit post Do I have an eating disorder I'm really confused right now about whether I have an eating disorder. I'm a 21 year-old, 5-10 male and am severely underweight. When I say that I mean I want to make it clear that severely means really, really, severely. I would only be at the correct weight, according to my doctor, if I would a lot shorter and female. When I used one of those BMI scanners in health class, it just read "error", though at the time I thought that meant I was in really good shape. Anyway, I eat 1-1.5 meals a day plus a snack or two. My meals are usually small compared to other people since I'm rarely hungry and get full easily. I had previously never worried about this, I was always underweight for my height, but it hasn't really affected my life as far as I can tell. I always eat when I'm hungry and eat till I'm full. In fact, sometimes I eat until I'm uncomfortably full. What brought on my concern is that I recently spent 5 days at the hospital. I was incredibly sick, and couldn't hold down and food or liquid and had to go to the hospital to avoid dehydrating. At first the doctors thought I had a flu or something, but by the 2nd day 4 out of 5 times I was visited by a doctor it was a psychiatrist, they were weighing my food before and after I ate and on the 4th day they told me they thought I might be anorexic. I told them that I wasn't, that I wanted to gain weight, but had a really hard time doing it. They didn't really listen to me and kept asking me over and over about if I skipped meals, and how I personally felt bout my weight, I told them I didn't skip meals and that I wanted to gain weight. At first they didn't believe me, then they said I might have anorexia without realizing it. I'm out of the hospital now, but they want me to see a psychiatrist and a therapist about whether I have an eating disorder or not. They said my health could be in serious jeopardy. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is whether or not I actually have an eating disorder, and should see the doctors (an important note is that I'm a broke college student with no health insurance and only want to take this route if I'm really in danger) or if I just have bad eating habits and should maybe work to improve my diet. Important things I want to reiterate are that I never don't eat on purpose, except sometimes if I'm feeling really depressed, but that doesn't happen too often, and that I feel like my health is fine, in fact I play tennis and teach it to kids over the summer. I just want someone to tell me whether I have an eating disorder or just bad eating habits? I've never really thought about this before, but the doctors at the hospital really scared and confused me. They even told my parents that they think I have an eating disorder and now my parents won't stop bugging me about it. I really need an answer. Request: Need immediate help for GF who is having a breakdown 2014-11-01 19:17:16 reddit post Not going to get into a long description of what's going on, but my GF is having a complete breakdown (by her own admission) and says she needs to talk to someone immediately. The phone numbers for NEDA and ANAD are not open on the weekend. She is self-harming. Her mind is on overdrive with thoughts of self-hate, abuse, body-shaming, "not deserving food/love", etc. She has been suffering from ED for years, but it has been extremely bad for about a year and half. She went into an outpatient facility about 8 months but broke away from guidelines while there and quickly turned to old habits after leaving. She was seeing a therapist who dropped her a couple months ago and she has stopped seeing her nutritionist. She says she has no one to talk to about what she is going through, but she is at a breaking point and desperately needs to talk to someone. We have very little money and she does not have insurance. I know she needs long-term help, but is there any outlet for her to reach out to today? Request: How do I talk to my husband about my eating disorder - food addiction? 2014-10-31 15:35:16 reddit post I've been struggling with food addiction for several years. I have good years and bad years, good days and bad days. When we started dating I was in a good place, but now, after a couple years of marriage my monster is starting to emerge from its cave. I had been very good about healthy eating and regular exercise, but lately I can't get my shit together. I tried to tell him a couple weeks ago, "that I'm not just a girl struggling to lose weight, I have a real problem." I'm not sure he really understands the extent of it, or thinks of it as a real disorder. His response was, "ok." Last night after dinner with a friend i stopped at two places on the way home for extra treats. I felt like shit about it, obviously, and this morning when he rolled over and put his arm around me I recoiled and said, "please don't touch my stomach." I DO NOT want to push him away, hide things from him, or withdraw into hiding as is bound to happen. First, what do I say so that he truly understands that food addiction is a real, serious thing? Second, what kind of support is helpful from him? I don't know how to lean on someone for something that I've always kept fiercely private. I have no doubt that he will be supportive, but I don't think either of us know what that really means. I've never sought counseling for this before, but I think it's time to do so. I cannot watch myself repeat cycles of massive weight gain and depression, and I cannot hide from my marriage because of my disorder. Request: Eating Disorder Triggered Due to Ex's Comments 2014-10-30 20:21:55 reddit post Two weeks ago my boyfriend of almost two years confessed he had been 'living a double life" and was cheating with his ex-girlfriend (which was also his girlfriend - he had two girlfriends - me and her). He told me he was in love with her and was breaking it off with me to be with her and her two children. He let me know all this via email. His other girlfriend (she lives in another state) didn't know that he and I were still together - -- he told her that we had broke up in May --- which wasn't the case. I knew there was an problem due to the decrease of sex in our relationship - which I addressed with him and he stated it was due to him going through depression. As someone who has been through depression off and on all my life - I tried to be understanding and backed off the issue for a while. Offering him advice, support and time. Well, all that time he had been having sex with her - he was going back to his hometown every month -- which is 6 hrs from where we live to be with her - and do all the relationship/couple things I wanted to do with him - with her. The issue is - even though I wasn't IN love - I loved him and cared about him a lot and also thought we had a great and supportive friendship aspect of our relationship. So, I feel betrayed and really hurt. He knew that I have been dealing with eating disorders (anorexia and bulimia) all my life. He also knows/knew that I battled with disordered eating/thoughts daily (hence ED recovery books all over the apartment) and that I am in therapy for it. He also knew he was my first real relationship in three years -- since I got serious about recovery. After he let me know he wanted to be with his ex - his ex reached out to me to tell me she didn't know that we were still together and to basically rag on him and compare notes - since he was with us both at the same time. In our conversation with each other she said that he claimed he broke up with me in May and the reason was I wanted an increase in sex (which I did ask him for - so he shared that with her) --- and that he was not physically attracted to me - so he couldn't have sex with me like that. But, he told her that with her --he could ALL THE TIME. In the last month or so, we had been having sex more regularly and thought his "depression" was improving. When she told me that, I felt terrible and broken. All that time, I thought he liked me and was very attracted to me - as that is what he stated when he pursued me hard for three months in the beginning of our relationship and always acted as he was. I know that I am attractive and I don't have issues with men trying to get to know me - and he knows that. But, it is my own thoughts about myself that keep me from engaging or entertaining men for relationships and/or friendships. I am currently at a healthy weight. I feel I could stand to lose some lbs but I overall I think I am ok. His other girl is taller and weighs more than me - but I guess it's packaged better to him. I don't know.... Since this has happen my ED is back in full effect. I have told my therapist and been reading all I can on self compassion and esteem - but I still feel terrible. What makes it worst is my family and friends think I am already too small at this weight -- and they are worried that my ED is back - and now I have BD symptoms cause I see something totally different than what everyone else is seeing. What do I do? I am trying to let his comments go and not care and continue my recovery but I feel like I am right back where I started. Request: How much can I lean on my boyfriend for help? Bulimia, binge / purge. 2014-10-29 14:39:42 reddit post After a particularly bad week of relapse, I have broken down to my boyfriend a lot. Sometimes I forget how hard it is for that person helping too. He struggles to understand why I do it and I can see the frustration when he sees me binge straight after purging. In an attempt to get a better understanding of it all, he tried looking for information online but got too upset and couldn't bring himself to watch the videos on it. I've been so blind to how much this is hurting him and feel awful that I'm putting this pressure on him. How far can I really go? I've started lying to him now and told him I went a whole day without purging just to give him some relief from it all. I wouldn't be trying to change this part of my life without him because I know that it would be unsuccessful. He allows me to rant about my problems and doesn't judge me when he finds me sneaking food or sneaking off to the toilet. But now I'm worried it's going to get too much for him. Anybody out there with family or friends with bulimia, how did you cope? When is it time for me to stop leaning on him when I feel myself slipping? Request: Sick of being like this and don't know what to do, binge eating 2014-10-29 14:36:13 reddit post I don't even know where to start with this, there's too much to say for one reddit post. I've realised in the past year that I have a problem with binge eating, and have done for a huge part of my life. But only recently it's become a huge problem. I have reached breaking point. Every day I'm fighting the same fucking battle. I hate my body, so I go on a health kick that lasts about two days. I go running, I count calories, the whole shebang. Then I decide it won't make a difference, then go on a huge binge, then feel awful about myself and lock myself away and cry. Rinse and repeat. And I'm sick of it. I hate feeling this way, I hate my body, I hate this awful unhealthy relationship that I have with food. I really don't know what to do or where to turn, I don't even know if there's any point in attempting to fix this, because every time I try, I just relapse and binge. It's an endless cycle. How can I learn to appreciate my body? Ways of dealing with stress and other unpleasant emotions? Where do I start? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Request: How to get help while studying abroad 2014-10-28 13:05:58 reddit post I am a 21yo female in college and have always been on the lower range of a healthy body weight. Last November I realized I had gained some weight after not exercising regularly--as I had been all throughout high school--so I started to count my calories and exercise 5days/wk. My family was thrilled that I had begun to exercise more. They have always been supportive and encouraged sports, healthy eating, and a healthy body. I ended up losing fat and gaining some muscle, which I was really happy about and I felt great! But then I broke up with my long-term SO, changed my college major, and decided to study abroad. I guess that's where the tipping point was. I then started getting almost addicted to the feeling of seeing the numbers on the scale go down and seeing that my clothes were getting looser. I would count calories obsessively and follow a low-carb, vegetarian diet. 7 months after I decided to begin losing weight, I am now very underweight. I can't stop thinking about food and calories and carb content. I am chronically constipated and constantly feel cold despite living abroad in 80-90F weather every day. I avoid going out to dinner with my friends here, and don't go out drinking with them because of the added empty calories. I have begun to get worried about my health and don't know what to do. Like I said, I am currently studying abroad so I don't have family or close friends here to talk to. I also do not have access to a health care provider except for the university health service here... which I am hesitant to go to, as they may not understand me. My question is: What should I do for help? I don't want to worry my parents/family back home by telling them I may have a problem since I'm so far away. Is there a group or provider/counselor I can email or talk to via internet (I only have a Chinese phone)? I don't think I'm so out of control that I necessarily need a counselor, so is there a way I can help myself by myself? Thank you very much. I really appreciate your help! Request: How to approach roommate who I believe is bulimic 2014-10-28 13:04:25 reddit post Hi there! I have a roommate that I'm pretty positive is bulimic. I just wanted to ask whats the right way to ask or if I should catch him red handed (I easily could). We're pretty close but this is a sensitive subject and I would like some advice. Request: How to help bulimic girlfriend 2014-10-28 13:03:16 reddit post My girlfriend drunkenly admitted to me last friday that she is clinically depressed and not and meds, and bulimic. She told me that her body is used to throwing up at least once a day. I've dealt with depression before for myself, and I know how to help in a way, but I have no idea how to help her with her eating disorder, and I imagine they are very linked. She told me that being bulimic has "kept her grounded" for a long time. I told her that I could not abide it - meaning that I can't allow myself to ignore it, which she asked me to. She said "I get selfish when I get drunk", which I guess means she thinks putting her issues on me is selfish? I told that it isn't at all. The other thing I told her was that anytime she felt the need to make herself throw up, to call me or text me, and I would get there immediately, or talk to her immediately. I've also been asking her at least once every day "how she is doing" meaning if she has made it through the day without forcing herself to throw up. We made it through the weekend without an incident, but today she was feeling nauseous and made herself throw up to get rid of the feeling. She had also been experiencing trouble keeping at least one of her meals down each day, but was able to do it, probably because we were together most of the weekend and she forced herself to keep it down. But she told me today "I messed up" and told me what happened. She is very scared to stop her habits because she believes they help her stay grounded. Please help me! Is her case severe? Does she need to be checked into a treatment centre or at least get a treatment program? I am the only she has told, and she didn't even mean to tell me. So if a treatment was to happen she would have to tell at least her mother, which I think she should anyways. I can use any advice you have! please, thank you Request: Just recently acknowledged I binge eat and don't even know where to begin.. 2014-10-27 11:52:37 reddit post I've recently come to terms with the fact I'm a binge eater, and it's been a legitimate issue I've struggled with for as long as I can remember, although I've only just recently acknowledged it's existence in my life. I can't exactly identify why (at least there was no major motivating factor)...it's just simply something I've done. I first looked into the world of binge eating a couple of months ago...I had never really given serious thought to that subject before. Over the next month or so, I kept an eye on my hunger habits and routines. I realized that I never really reach a point of satisfaction. There's always some sort of hunger burning in my stomach. I'm a 21 year old guy who used to be a pretty unhealthy individual, but around March I decided to change my diet and exercising habits and ended up losing some weight and getting in better physical shape. Today, I still maintain good exercise habits, and in terms of quality my choices in food are pretty healthy as well. Still, I feel like all of the effort I'm putting into steering myself back on track with exercising and dieting is being nulled by the fact I can never seem to satisfy my hunger and over indulge myself with huge quantities of food. I struggled in life with severe depression and anxiety, and I sought out help about a year ago. I'm in a far better place than I was around that time, although like everyone else recovering I still have my moments. I don't personally think any of those issues contribute to the binge eating, though I could be wrong. As someone completely new to this world and as someone finally acknowledging as issue like this in my life, I ask my friends in this community to help a guy just know where to even start. What are some resources I should be looking into? Who should I talk to about it (I can't really afford therapy atm..)? Strategies? Any help would be genuinely appreciated. Thanks for taking a few seconds out of your day for a guy who feels a little in over his head. Smile today. Request: I don't know when to stop eating! Help?? 2014-10-27 01:39:46 reddit post Background: long story short: I spent the last summer eating too little calories and over-exercising. I lost some weight because of it, and am now at an unhealthy BMI. Issue: Now that I'm trying to recover my lost weight, I don't know when I am supposed to stop eating. I am currently lifting light weights to make sure the mass I gain balanced, but I still don't feel confident with over-eating. For instance, just today I know that I went over the calories I needed by a reasonable amount. However, I ate some bad food that was high in calories and low in nutrients, so I am still hungry. I really want to eat some more food so I can feel full, but I know I will just be eating an unhealthy high amount. Should there be a cap for how many calories I eat, or is it more important that I feel full? 2014-10-26 18:15:35 reddit post Hopefully helpful posts: [Helping gf](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1pl03w/sharing_girlfriend_is_recovering_from_bulimia/) [What not to say](http://www.anad.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/What-Not-To-Say.pdf) [Helping gf #2](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/2ajwpb/sharing_some_of_my_personal_experince_on_how_to/) [Help gf](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1y5gup/request_how_to_help_my_gf/) 2014-10-26 18:12:17 reddit post Thanks.

Long story short - after a friend of hers passed away from anorexia, she told me she is in recovery from anorexia and currently bulimic. I was pretty rocked to be honest.

For some background, my ED is basically binging and purging all of the time, I rarely restrict (despite my diagnosis of AN), and that is what I am trying to recover from. I was in IP in August and discharged with an OP team and a meal plan. I stopped seeing my OP dietician, however, at the end of September because my insurance was not covering it, and she wasn't helping at all (I was following my meal plan to a T and didn't restore weight and all she told me was to eat desserts with every meal). My main problem is this: I can't stop binging and purging, and no one seems to even recognize it as an issue despite my insistence that I need help with it. Especially with all of the doctors I saw in IP, it seems they took one look at me, saw that I'm underweight, and assumed that I am restricting. No matter how many times I said that I hardly restrict, I just binged and purged all day, they won't address it. When I go to my dad's house, he'd stock up on junk food and pressure me to eat it all, essentially pressuring me into a relapse. It took me MONTHS to convince him that binging is, in fact, what I'm trying to recover from. And when I go see my OP team and tell them of an episode, they just say "I'm glad you gave yourself permission to eat that! You're doing so well!" as if it were some sort of triumph and not a terrible demon that I feel is controlling my life. I would understand this attitude if I were recovering from restricting type AN, since binging is a fairly normal part of recovery. But I hardly restrict which is part of what terrifies me. But I feel like I'm going insane from this. The urge to binge is constant and I have to fight it every moment of every day. I made it three weeks free, and while I thought it would get easier to resist, it just felt like it got more difficult everyday until I simply couldn't handle it anymore and I turned into a raging monster tearing through half of the refrigerator. It doesn't help that no one seems to understand what the real problem is, and they're practically congratulating me every time I relapse. I would also understand if this had only started recently. So, I don't really want to do the MinnieMaud approach of letting myself eat whatever I want because I know that binging is mainly just a destructive coping mechanism for me and I don't want to reinforce it. Especially because I don't think that I would be able to stop binging, even when I got back up to a normal weight. What helped you through recovery? How did you get others to understand that binging and purging is the problem?

Request: Baby steps towards recovery. (Male, 20 yrs old), previously anorexia, now bulimia (non-vomiting) 2014-10-26 02:05:38 reddit post Alright, so I am a 20 year old male who struggled with anorexia for around a year, following some drastic changes in my life. It caused severe effects to my body, but I am now at a much healthier weight although I do not quite have the athletic muscles that I used to. I am an active guy though. I enjoy running and have been trying to lift some weights recently to gain back some muscle. But currently, I struggle with Bulimia (non-vomiting) and it is something that drives me absolutely nuts because it dictates my life, prevents me from being/feeling normal, and just fuels my overall depression. I truly want to make some changes with my eating disorder, but as I'm sure you all know, my mind prevents me from taking the actions that I have began to realize that I need to take. I just really want some help because I am at University now and I have not been enjoying myself, have had no self-esteem, and have yet to make friends. I really believe this eating disorder is preventing me from being myself. By the way, this subreddit has been EXTREMELY useful for helping me understand my condition a little bit better. But, I am submitting this because all of our circumstances are unique and the best advice is tailored to our own personal needs. This eating disorder has seriously been the most difficult thing I have ever been though, and it has cost me some really valuable things in life. It has gone on too long and I am becoming desperate for help since I don't have anyone to talk to about it. If you guys need to know anything else, I'd be more than happy to go into more detail. One of the weird habits that continues to humiliate me is my relationship with restricting carbs. I really want to eliminate that mind block because I feel like gradually introducing carbs back into my diet will allow me to eat a bit more freely, like I used to. The whole "low-carb" trend has really messed with the way my mind views carbs. But, I feel like it will remove a large portion of the the anxiety I have towards food if I can eat them again. So, this is the first tiny step I want to actively take towards being "recovered". It seems so simple, but my mind has convinced me otherwise. So, how can I introduce some carbs back into my diet without bingeing on them? For some time now, I haven't been eating any carbs at all and I am aware that it is a problem in my life. I try not to even look at the Nutrition Facts on food any more, as it fuels my anxiety. Anyways, I just want to thank you guys in advanced, whether I get any responses or not. Feel free to ask any more questions. 2014-10-25 06:24:05 reddit post Hopefully helpful posts: [Relapse](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/2j7kf8/request_crazy_bingepurge_relapse_after_8_years_of/) [Bulimia recovery sharing](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/2dc4rb/recovery_sharing_ziploc_bags_and_other_things/) [AMA on bulimia recovery](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1uob3k/ama_on_recovery_2_years_ago_i_recovered_from/) [Addressing Bulimia](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/24g5vt/request_how_to_begin_addressing_bulimia/) Request: My will to not purge is failing. Need advice on how to turn away from bulimia 2014-10-25 06:23:02 reddit post I had been slipping into my bulimic tendencies the last few months. I really thought I had control. Everything would be intentional and I could squash that inner voice telling me to purge at work. It didn't work tonight. I came back from dinner feeling full. The uncomfortable feeling overcame me. Before I knew it I was purging my dinner. I know the nurse heard it. Played it off that it was something I ate. I wasn't in control though. So I left early. I feel like such a piece of crap. I had this controlled and now I'm not just spiraling at home. It's happened at work. What do I do???? How do I not let bulimia into my life? rRequest: bulimia caused by poverty, food insecurity 2014-10-25 01:25:49 reddit post Hi there, I'm hoping somebody will be able to help, because there's not a lot of info online about what I think is turning into bulimia. Here's the backstory: Earlier this year, I was laid off from my full-time job and the financial consequences swept me off my feet. I was raised upper-middle-class in Australia (now living in the US), am financially responsible, and went to an expensive private school, so I never thought that I would find myself living on the streets, but that's exactly what happened to me. I lived out of my car for three months, and often ate food from dumpsters (or occasionally stole it from tables in fast food restaurants) because I felt bad accessing resources for the homeless as I felt that I had had a good life so far and didn't deserve the help. (My parents didn't want to help me and I didn't want to burden my friends by asking for help.) Now, I'm back on my feet with a place to live and a full-time job that pays more than most people my age earn (I'm 23), and life is getting back to normal. However, now I feel out of control with binging - not so much out of a low self-esteem, but out of a suffocating awareness of how easily I could topple into poverty. Whenever I see food, I eat it all. I can't keep food in the house because I eat until the pantry is empty and I feel sick. I then feel really bad about myself because like any 23-year-old female, I want to be attractive and healthy. (Plus, I used to work in high fashion, and I never used to eat then like I do now.) But I know the big problem here is that I can't shake the feeling of food insecurity. I can't stop feeling like I may not be able to buy food for the next week and I might have to dig in rubbish bins in parks at night again. I KNOW I have a job now and everything's ok. But I don't know how to get out of feeling this way and binging like there's no tomorrow as if I don't know when my next meal will come...please help! I feel awful. How can I shake the feeling of food insecurity? Thank you. Request: Recovering bulimic dieting, don't want to slip into old habits. 2014-10-24 15:56:18 reddit post I have been in recovery for about two years and in that time I have become overweight. I am now in the situation where I need to loose a modest amount to return to a healthy weight (Dr.'s advice not mine) and am now dieting and working out to achieve this. I've downloaded an app to make sure that I'm eating enough and track my nutrition. I've found that I've been slipping into old habits a lot easier than I like and it scares me. I'm consistently under eating and working out and last week I purged for the first time in over a year. Are there other people with this problem and what are coping mechanisms they use to deal with it? Request: Binging in Recovery, hopelessness, social concerns about gaining weight 2014-10-24 15:52:14 reddit post I have just binged after been doing pretty well in recovery for awhile. I've been so bored and I think that's what triggered it, or maybe I just don't want to dig deeper. I just really hate that I feel like I am not going to get out of this cycle and I'm just going to keep gaining weight and gaining weight. I hadn't binged in over a month around. I mean i guess I've had mini ones but not a real full out binge in a long time. I knew that If i just kept watching tv I would have been fine, or If I wouldn't have gotten that one snack. I'm just so pissed. Like why. Why can't I just be normal. Can I please have some advice and how you guys deal with binging in recovery? I'm crying as I write this, just feeling hopeless. I can't keep gaining weight, nobody is going to want to be associated with me, I wouldn't want to associate with myself. I just really need someone right now. Much love, XOXO Request: Is it counter intuitive to count calories in recovery? 2014-10-23 04:42:23 reddit post When my ED was in its prime, I would spend the whole day frightened by an arbitrary number such as a calorie. Now that I'm in recovery, I've learned to simply enjoy food and live each day based on what my body wants. However, there's a problem. I've been living this way for about a month now and have seen no results in terms of weight gain. Could this mean that I need to eat more than what my body wants? Or that I have lost touch with what my body wants? Do I need to count calories to make sure I get at least xx amount of calories each day, or would this lead to another eating disorder entirely? Request: Is there such a thing as a full recovery? 2014-10-22 17:23:43 reddit post I was wondering if anyone has real successful recovery stories to share. Or if there's such a thing as a full recovery or if it's something like AA, you have to struggle everyday forever. I'm asking this because I've struggled with EDNOS for what I thought had been 6 years. In 2007/08 I had gotten out of a relationship, was going through some difficult things in my life and started blaming it all on myself and I despised the way I looked. I started regularly dieting, eating low carbs, lean proteins, etc. I lost weight. I came back to my country after a month traveling and losing weight and plateaued. So I restricted a little more my calorie intake. Next thing I know, I'm obsessed with calories. I memorize whole lists of calories and then start betting against myself to see what was the littlest I could eat everyday. If I ever went over a certain amount I'd purge. (I never binged tho). As it usually goes with this disease, I started withdrawing from my family and friends company because social gatherings would usually involve food. I lied all the time and when I couldn't avoid eating, I'd purge afterwards. That went on without stop for a little more than 3 years. Then in 2012 I had to undergo a procedure, but I needed to gain weight. I forced myself into recovery and gained the necessary weight, and actually kept myself "healthy" for sometime. After that I just started gaining weight uncontrollably and long story short (not really), I'm going through everything again. I can't eat, I cry out of anxiety when I have to go out, etc. But that's not the reason why I ask. Last night I was at my parents' and I found some old journals. Some of the stuff was from 2003/04, 4 years before what I thought was my "full blown" condition. And there are pages and pages of odes to how I hated myself and calling me names for being what I considered to be overweight and one of the entries shocked me as I narrated how I had felt guilty after eating out with some friends from uni and then forced myself to purge for the first time ever. And how good it felt to be able to do that and in control. I was shocked because I honestly didn't remember those things or those feelings. I know I've always hated myself and the way I look, but I didn't remember I had had an episode before 08. As I read it became clearer to me I had gone through similar stuff before (restricting, lying, purging, taking meds, etc) and recovered when I quit uni. I don't remember what motivated me to do so, but then in 08 it happened again, and now it's happening again after a brief "normal" period... Is this gonna be my life forever? Is there something wrong with me (other than the obvious)? Request: My former boyfriend has left me because of my EDNOS - how do I cope? 2014-10-22 17:22:30 reddit post I've been with my boyfriend for nearly two years and throughout those years he's known I've had EDNOS - he's never really coped that well when the issue arises so I've tried not to raise the issue too much. But recently things have been tough. This morning, I received a message from him with the dreaded words... "I think this is too much for me and I can't deal with it anymore. I'm so sorry. I'll be asking to see your doctor on an individual basis to discuss everything I know. I'm taking it into my own hands whether you want it or not and I'm afraid I'll have to leave it there." I'm really desperate, even crying whilst I type this, because I have nowhere else to turn. I'm so sorry to have to post something as insignificant as this but nobody I'm currently in contact with knows about my ED aside from my ex. My first question is - how on earth can I cope knowing he's left me because of my eating disorder, when that in itself is the most triggering thing ever for my eating disorder to continue? And two; how on earth can I stop him from going to my doctor and getting everyone involved, when I know from previous personal experience that that broken trust and any kind of forced recovery never works?! (EDIT: He has already gone through with what he said and has told the receptionist at my doctors who will forward his concern to my GP. I'm from the UK and I'm 20 years old so I am aware of the notion of confidentiality, but I'm beside myself as I don't know how this would apply in this situation - it's all so complicated because he brought my severe depression into it too). Thanks in advance if you read. Request: What to do about sister 2014-10-22 12:14:12 reddit post My sister (older teenager) 3 years ago started to show signs of being anorexic. We were oblivious about it for too long-you never think these things happen to you. For a while we didn't get any professional help but merely tried to encourage her to eat more. This didn't work so well. Things slowly became worse. She became very moody, reclusive and her eating habits became stranger and stranger. Recently she went to a clinic for eating disorders after she became dangerously thin. ( heart rate was 30-40 bpm and she looked very sick) and that seemed to do nothing besides managing to get her back up to a semi decent weight. However since then her weight has clearly dropped once again. She absolutely refuses to believe she has a problem and gets very aggressive when we try to approach her about it. It's caused a LOT of stress in our family and right now we're just running out of options. I can't see her going Have any of you ever been in a situation like this? What can I do as her brother? (I'm several years older.) I've really noticed it straining my parent's marriage. I'm especially worried that it may affect her younger sisters (ages 8-13). Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks you guys. Request: Triggered after therapy 2014-10-21 23:34:42 reddit post I recently submitted a post about whether or not the 'something isn't right' feeling is a good indicator that my behaviour might be disordered. Since that time my eating disorder has progressed but I also decided that I wanted to strike now and possibly prevent many years of heartache and struggle. I had my initial appointment with a psychologist yesterday and while I feel that it went well and I really liked her and valued the space to talk about what's been going on, I found the whole thing very emotionally draining and therefore quite triggering. There was a lot of numbers talk (which she assured me was just the first appointment) and I found that particularly difficult, because I have gained a bit in the last few days which obviously is tough. The first thing I did when I left was binge. You can guess the second. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experience with therapy being triggering and how you have coped with it? Is it appropriate to ask my therapist to work with me on some strategies to avoid b/p or major restriction after a session? I want to stick with it but not if it's going to be like this every time. 2014-10-21 15:38:08 reddit post Hopefully helpful post: [Dieting vs Eating Disorder](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1l40q4/post_request_how_do_i_do_things_like_try_to_eat/). 2014-10-21 15:30:39 reddit post Hopefully helpful links and post: [Anorexia and Bulimia and fertility](http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/news/20110805/eating-disorders-affect-fertility-pregnancy) [EDs and Pregancy](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/pregnancy-and-eating-disorders) [Pregnant and disordered](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/2ivccs/request_pregnant_and_disordered_how_can_i_make/) Post request: How to differentiate between orthorexia and just wanting to be healthy? Healthy diet vs ED? 2014-10-21 15:20:00 reddit post I'm one of those people who have jumped on the health and fitness bandwagon, but along the way, I did realize that some restrictive behaviours developed. But since then, I have made the conscious decision to recover. So I'm just wondering how you would differentiate an orthorexic from someone who just wants to be healthy? Like, if someone doesn't want to eat a cupcake because they know it's not the "healthiest" option, are they orthorexic, or just health conscious? I guess what I really want to know is if I'm hindering my own recovery/wellbeing by wanting to eat clean, stick to healthier foods, and live healthily, etc. Thank you so much! Request: I think I need help, teen with bulimia, parents don't seem to know what to do. 2014-10-21 15:17:58 reddit post I'm in high school, and meet (and exceed) the criteria for bulimia nervosa. My parents found my texts when I confessed my story to a friend, so they know most of it. Thing is, they don't do anything about it. I guarantee they hear my purging, and they're around when I binge. I don't know if I should push the issue and ask for a therapist or not. I kind of want to, because I can't talk to anyone else about it. I'm too scared to text because of what happened, but I'm also too nervous to discuss it in person. I would rather avoid the topic entirely, actually. I cry and break down if I do talk face-to-face about it. I guess my situation is that I don't know how to go about recovery. I feel like I can't begin to recover unless I get officially diagnosed, otherwise I feel like an attention-seeking teenager who exaggerates her problems. Putting a diagnosis to it would be like saying, "Yes, your problems are real. Now go fix them." Does that make sense? I'm so conflicted about the whole thing. I feel like bulimia has taken over me, like a sheet. And underneath that sheet is EDNOS or something, as another sheet. Then underneath that is me. Because if I'm not overeating, I'm not eating at all. Like if I manage to peel off the top layer, another ED is waiting beneath it. I'll cross that bridge when I get there, I guess. How can I get help? How do I talk about this with my parents? Does therapy just mean a diagnosis and then "Now go fix it"? Would therapy help me learn to change? Request: Has anyone gotten pregnant while coping with ED? Can EDs effect the chances of having children? 2014-10-21 15:10:56 reddit post Not sure if this belongs here or r/pregnant, but I have been battling bulimia for 5 years (shortly after I had my first child). My BMI is on the cusp of being underweight. I've been better though. Eating more and purging less and I have not had an incident for two weeks (I have done this multiple times a day at times). My periods are always regular, but now I'm two months late with a negative three negative pregnancy tests. I've been feeling healthier and don't have any other underlying issues as I just saw my primary doctor a week ago. How likely is it that i messed up my chances of having more children? Has anyone had success or know anyone that has? Thank you. Post Request- I'm spiraling into an eating disorder, family history of EDs, I don't know why my mood keeps going like this. 2014-10-21 15:06:27 reddit post I don't even know where to start. I started losing weight and while I've always hated my body, I didn't think I would spiral into an eating disorder. I didn't start off counting calories, but I get so upset now if I don't know the calories in something. I haven't started purging yet, but I sometimes feel like it. This is horrible and I don't want to keep feeling like this. Sometimes I feel completely in control and the next moment I'm obsessing over what I just ate or thought about eating. I kept denying that there was anything wrong, but normal people don't cry about eating in a restaurant or about how much oil someone has used in their cooking. I feel like I might end up triggering my mum as well. She was severely anorexic when she was younger and nearly died from it and while she's been recovered for years, she admitted that she still cries sometimes when she looks in the mirror. I feel like my entire family is insane because basically every girl on my mum's side has had an eating disorder. My sister has tried starving herself and has cried about being weighed and my oldest female cousin nearly died from anorexia. My other female cousin has recently gained some weight after showing signs of an eating disorder and now I'm dealing with this. My parents are trying to help, but my father telling me that 'I'm going to be exactly where I belong soon' and telling me that he is going to lock me in a hospital EVERY time an issue with with my eating comes up, is making me want to scream and cry and either break down or destroy something. I feel so unstable right now and I don't know why my mood keeps going like this. I'm going into treatment, but it's still a month away and I don't know how the hell I'm going to cope until then because I know that I'm getting worse every week. Does anyone have any advice or anything to alleviate my mood swings slightly? How do I deal with my parents? Request: How did you accept the fact that you will gain body-fat during recovery? 2014-10-20 04:09:46 reddit post I consider myself to be on a recovery from a restrictive eating disorder, but I still haven't gained weight. I believe this is because although I believe I am eating more, my ED is still influencing my decisions. I've learned that if I am going to gain weight, I won't be able to do it with my safe foods. However, the idea of eating unsafe foods without recording how much I am eating still scares me. I'm doing moderate weightlifting, but what if all my excess calories just makes me fat? I'd like to reach a normal BMI and don't know if it will lead to binge eating. As a kid, I ate junk food all the time. However, I don't know if I can return to that lifestyle without killing my health and becoming obese. How do you accept the fact that you will gain weight, body-fat, during recovery? Request: How to tell my housemate I have bulimia? 2014-10-20 04:06:26 reddit post I've been bulimic for 13 years. I eat everything in the house and purge regularly.

REQUEST: Help talking to a teammate with a potential ED (TW!). 2014-10-18 04:34:23 reddit post Hi, long story short, I think my teammate has an ED. I went to her room today with another teammate (who is oblivious) and some little notes caught my eye. They said horrible, horrible things. I myself have fully recovered from EDNOS/bulimia (as much as one can) and I am happy, healthy, and even lucky enough to not be susceptible to triggers. But I've been to that dark place and seeing those quotes really flashed me back for the first time in over 3 years. They are the things you would see on the pro-ED blogs that I frequented long ago. Her roomie also made a comment about how she brings her toothbrush everywhere, and while that could be just her thing, its just SO many red flags. If she doesn't have an ED, she's definitely having disordered thoughts. Me and this girl are fairly close, we both have anxiety and depression and have bonded a little over it and we've reached out to one another after panic attacks. I think that if anybody could reach out with respect and care, I think I could. Because I recovered without anybody confronting me, I need a little help on what might be the best way to do this. I'd like to invite her one on one to my apartment and offer her a shoulder/venting space, a cat to cuddle (she loves cats a lot), or just my love and support and encourage her to see our free psychologist. I also would like to share my story with her so she knows that I at least can empathize with her. I know not to accuse or be forceful and I understand firsthand the attachment one can get to their disorders and how defensive/angry/scared they can be. I know I shouldn't threaten her by outing her. I'm also not a Christian but she has a strong relationship with God and I wonder if she might like relevant scripture or something like that. If she's receptive, where do I go from there? What if she denies? Or if she's angry? How can I get the most positive reaction? I want to offer myself and my experiences as a resource for her and let her know that help is available and encourage her. I'm very worried for her, so any advice would be great. Thanks! Request: Very concerned about a 7 year old. 2014-10-18 04:31:13 reddit post I suffered with anorexia in and out of the hospital for two years, and of course it affected my whole family. It has now been about a year since i've been out of the hospital, and i'm doing better. The problem is that my younger sister, who basically had to grow up watching me destroy myself, is now restricting what she eats, because she wants to be 'tall and thin like her older sister as she's heard my family say so many times that i am tall and thin. I am very concerned about her health and that this may progress dangerously. I want to do whatever i can to get her as far away from this mindset as possible, but i don't know how. I've got her coming to visit me as a 'play date' at my apartment, so i can show her that i eat, to show her that i do not restrict. She's so young and i don't know how to deal with these issues in a 7 year old. I would really appreciate any advice on how to approach this.

For ~8 years I've been living normal life, with some ED thoughts but nothing serious. My relationship with my SO hit a really rough patch lately, and I'm now on a three-day long binge-purge marathon, and I don't know what to do. I don't have any contact to health care/therapy at the moment. I'm on antidepressants.

Request: How to handle lunchtime with dieting colleagues and their talk, particularly comments to me? 2014-10-13 21:34:47 reddit post I am currently a year in to my recovery for binge-purge bulimia. I have managed to stop purging (with some relapses over the year) but binge eating and body image are still areas I struggle with. I am currently having difficulty with the lunchtime situation at work. I have no option but to eat with colleagues. We bring in our own food, but I work in a school and so there is often a surplus of the children's cooked dinners (this often includes trays and trays of desserts). I am currently trying to include desserts into my diet in a healthy and moderate way but I still struggle a lot with guilt and sometimes portion sizes - I have a tendency to binge. My issue is that my colleagues are quite competitive dieters and often very restrictive in what they eat. I have come far enough to know that this type of dieting is extremely triggering and unhealthy for me. I am trying to step away from the thin ideal and restricting but this is something my colleagues believe in and engage in. It is really starting to get to me as I am trying to feel comfortable eating a dessert after lunch and eating carbohydrates etc. My colleagues often make comments such as "oh I see you struggle with willpower too" or "its not good to eat x, y, or z in x, y, or z quantities" or "I've cut out x, y and z nutrients because they make you fat" or moan about feeling fat/guilty if they do indulge in certain foods. I am finding this a minefield. I'm really at the beginning stages of trying to feel comfortable with my size and eating desserts etc. The comments my colleagues make about themselves and what they are eating stresses me out. I am not willing to discuss my eating disorder history with them. I am certain they would be extremely understanding if I did, but it doesn't feel professional somehow and it's not something I am comfortable doing. Any tips on staying strong and comfortable with my decisions? Also suggestions for ways to avoiding this from becoming triggering would be extremely helpful. Request: Designing an Outpatient Facility- thesis research by someone in recovery from an eating disorder 2014-10-13 21:11:29 reddit post I struggled with an eating disorder for over 9 years. Because of this close personal connection, I decided to do my Interior Design senior thesis on a outpatient eating disorder facility. I was always afraid of getting help because I believed I 'wasn't sick enough' or I was just afraid of getting better. My goal is to design a community rather than a 'clinic'. I want my design to encourage social support, remove stigma, and encourage recovery. As part of my research, I would love to get input from other people suffering with ED. * What made you decide that you needed to seek treatment? * How did you make your decision on whether to do outpatient or inpatient? How did you choose the facility? * What were issues- if any- that you felt your therapy space had? * Is there anything that you would hope to see in a eating disorder center? * What do you believe to be the most important spaces in a facility towards recovery?

Let's just consider the physiology of undereating (restricting) and overeating (binging). True. Eating disorders are mental disorders. Professional psychological help is often necessary for recovery. Dieticians are also often a key part of recovery. We can't help all the people all the time, but if we can help some of the people some of the time, it's good. 2014-10-09 15:53:43 reddit post These hunger hormones are similar to other hormones in our bodies (such as a woman's estrogen cycle) in that they can't be quickly turned on and off. The JAMA article linked is a study that has proven hunger hormones take a long time to return to normal after periods of undereating. There are suggestions under each of the hormones mentioned for what to do to help them return to normal. For example, for cortisol, try to rest more by lying down even if not sleeping. For ghrelin, eating every few hours (for example, 3 meals a day, 2 snacks) helps bring that hormone back into balance so that binges have one less biological stimulus. There are many hormones that regulate hunger, more than can be listed and many still not understood. However, the ones listed offer a variety of solutions to begin to help calm the body as a part of recovery. 2014-10-08 18:03:11 reddit post Hopefully helpful previous posts and links: [Anorexia Workbook](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/qpf61/the_anorexia_workbook_how_to_accept_yourself_heal/).

It's probably a logarithmic curve where they are strongest and steepest in the beginning weeks/months, and then they balance out. Also, if you have heart issues that are psychological, therapy is a remedy. If the heart issues are physical, see a medical professional. Stay with it. Recovery is for life.

Giving the mods a note about posts like this is fine. 2014-03-23 18:33:24 reddit post reply fom misspolkadot: You've identified that you're self-medicating with food, as you were with cutting and drinking, so finding a healthy alternative (or a few) will be an essential part of abstaining/recovering from binging. Journaling, reading, exercising, creating art...have something ready to turn to when you feel the urge to binge. Initially, it takes a lot of will power and conscious effort to make a better choice in those moments, but eventually with practice and time it will become more natural. Especially when you find a coping mechanism that actually fulfills you and gives you joy. Binging gives some immediate, but fleeting gratification and ultimately just produces more shame, guilt, and self-loathing. Something that helps me out a lot whenever I find myself relapsing with binge-eating is to practice mindful eating. For example, only eat sitting down at a table, use utensils, don't do other things while eating (i.e. watching TV, using the computer, etc.). I never actually binge at the kitchen table. It's usually in my room and I'm typically engaged in some other activity, like watching a TV show, so making sure I sit down at a table to eat is a great deterrent. Makes me think about what I'm doing. You may also want to avoid trigger foods for a while. For example, I temporarily avoid things like white flour and sugar because it's like once I start I can't stop. A switch is flipped. So it's helpful to just abstain from those foods until I get back into a healthier eating pattern. As only_one_contact noted, it seems like being alone, particularly on the weekends, might be a trigger for you. Creating some structure for your weekends and sticking to it may be helpful. Plan activities! And then make yourself do them. Is therapy a feasible option for you? If you can afford it, I recommend working with a therapist to help discover and heal the root of the issue. 2014-03-23 18:32:59 reddit post Reply from only_one_contact : I am currently making a hard push for recovery on all fronts I used to/still struggle with (bingeing, purging, restricting, cutting, drugs). Being alone is a big trigger for me, too. It helps that I live with my partner, but when he leaves, I experience major urges for a half hour or so. If I can get through that time, I will usually be fine. Can you remind yourself that your desire to overeat is an urge and that it will pass? Do you think you might be restricting during the week, which sets you up to overeat on the weekends? If you stop overeating, it does not automatically mean you will return to cutting and/or drinking. If you can recognize your addictive behaviors as such, you can sit through the urges for any of them (sit and notice: "Wow, I really want to binge/cut/drink right now. What can I do instead?"). Cutting used to be a daily habit for me, but I haven't cut since 2009. I still want to sometimes. Which sucks; I had hoped the urges would be gone by now. But at least my urges to cut are manageable. My urges to binge, on the other hand...well, that's my fight right now. I have a lot of compassion for you and wish you the best. 2014-02-02 05:09:08 reddit post Another post that may help, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1wqyzu/how_do_i_think_better_about_food_and_not_obsess/). 2014-01-02 14:07:13 reddit post Before I Eat app [link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/before-i-eat-moment-in-zone/id733555197?mt=8).

So often we don't feel heard, or that no one hears us. Your gift of just some extra time to listen to her would be a tremendous gift. Perhaps share with her resources you've found valuable. Knowledge is necessary for freeing ourselves from our difficulties, a lot of which can persist because of a lack of knowledge. 2013-05-17 13:55:55 reddit post Another way of looking at treatment is to consider the stressful aspects of going now versus going after finals. You can easily tell friends you broke your knee and they would not judge you for missing finals. You can imagine explaining not only to friends but dealing with rumors amongst people who barely know you about leaving to get treatment at this time. It sounds like the girl has a lot to do already, and it will be much less stress for her in so many ways to wait a few weeks. EDs are life threatening, and they feed on stress. I would hope the girl will be better able to focus on, and make the best use of, recovery if she wasn't dealing with finals and such. If the girl was asking for attention, she did get the attention of her parents. 2013-04-20 15:08:15 reddit post Hi, This account is just used for posting requests.

Also, I highly recommend the book Intuitive Eating. For me, it was like reading my own mind about binging. It was written by doctors who specialize in this and it has comforted me and helped me immensely. 2013-02-25 14:49:25 reddit post Comment by Semiramis6: First of all, if you have the means, please seek professional help. I have found therapists and the medical community so helpful in my recovery. Second, I know it seems contradictory, but truly the best way to stop the cycle is to start eating. By fasting, you're setting yourself up for an eventual binge. I used to crave peanut butter, and I would not eat anything all day so I could have a small bowl (yep, a bowl) of peanut butter late at night. I felt out of control, I even started shopping around at different stores for peanut butter so no one store would realize how much of the stuff I bought. Give yourself a little extra breathing room, if possible. If you have a calorie limit for the day, tell yourself that if you go up to 200 calories over, it's still ok and you're not going to explode! If you are terrified of getting over a certain weight, add five pounds to that and tell yourself that although it's not ideal, those extra five pounds would still be ok and easy to lose eventually. I know this is a scary step. But that little bit of extra breathing room can work wonders, because as your limits probably are right now, you have no room for error. And as soon as you make one slip up, the day/week/month is ruined. I know the feeling well. Also, start eating regularly. Make yourself a meal plan, with all three meals of the day and a snack or two. AND STICK TO IT! By the time evening rolls around, you will be satiated with the meals you had. Your brain isn't going to be starving for energy and it will make the better decisions. Your body will be strong enough to walk away from the kitchen. By fasting all day, you're basically weakening your willpower muscle, and then it's so weak that it can't resist a binge. Again, I know this is scary. But it is the number one way to break the cycle of fast-binge-fast-binge. You could identify your triggers (stress? getting home at the end of the day? watching tv?) that make you binge, and change or eliminate them so that the desire to binge isn't as strong. As for guilt, I have always found it useful to keep busy and keep out of the house. Immediately after a meal, if I'm feeling guilty, I try to leave and go do something, hang out with friends, whatever. I distract myself from the guilty thoughts, and they eventually go away. You are strong enough to beat this and to stop the eating disorder from taking over your life. 2013-01-20 16:22:56 reddit post A reply from user--frostfromfire (had a technical difficulty, sorry): I can only speak as someone who struggled with restriction and had family/boyfriend saying awful things to me. Do not blame her when she becomes overly emotional. Speak cautiously and with concern, not blame. If discussion becomes too heated, say "I am going to give you some alone time" and walk away for at least 15 minutes. Any overtly negative comments can make her think negatively about you while shes upset. It's hard to say/do anything that won't be perceived wrong when emotions are at full blast, so usually it's better to say nothing and wait for a better time to listen/talk. 2013-01-12 15:41:34 reddit post An excellent book.

It's up. 2012-12-13 14:15:03 reddit post Actually, some people with EDs can loose the ability to recognize hunger signals. So, when someone with an ED says they are not hungry, they actually may not know if they are hungry or not. This leads to undernourishment, brittle bones, heart problems, kidney problems, a brain that doesn't work normally (emotions, clear thinking, etc), and on and on. 2012-11-26 14:33:50 reddit post If you can keep her from knowing, you might mention it to the doctors. However, they probably know. This is the nature of EDs. Secrecy (also known as lying) is a big part of it, somehow. The doctors and other resource specialists are well aware that this is going on, however, they are also well aware that if a patient doesn't want to get better, they can do nothing. Many patients gain the weight needed for discharge, only so they can get out and eat (or not eat, or overeat and purge) like they want to. 2012-08-22 15:10:59 reddit post message was sent. 2012-07-20 15:38:38 reddit post Although it seems many EDs are driven by difficult emotions, sometimes EDs are not driven by emotions as the book, [Brain Over Binge,](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/w6mmc/brain_over_binge_why_i_was_bulimic_why/) goes into in depth.

I can't imagine it working for someone because makes people like bricks after 30 minutes. Although I know someone with an ambien addiction who takes like 5 a day, I don't know how she does that. It was fun to take it but I wake up the next day with the phone having 40 minute conversations and things. Nothing too drastic. I can imagine ADHD being a lot like mania in a way. Not in the hyperactivity per se, but with racing thoughts and impulsivity. I have ADHD and I think it's in my nature to be more impulsive but not for manic reasons. Adderall calmed me down a lot. It was perfect but I can't take it anymore because it made my heart rate too fast. 2012-01-23 06:54:18 reddit post That's interesting. Have you tried other over the counter things such as Calcium and Magnesium? I've heard St Johns Wort could have a strong placebo effect. I wonder if that's not true, but something with subtler effects (such as SJW and magnesium) helps better for you. 2012-01-23 06:51:05 reddit post Hm, I've never had disturbances (would it be like hallucinations?) but I deal with derealization / depersonalization every once in a while outside from panic. My boyfriend wanted to hospitalize me when he didn't know what it was but it's funny that something as simple as klonopin helped. Lamictal helped a lot with that too. 2012-01-23 06:45:24 reddit post I became 88 pounds (being 5'4") but now I'm 104. I'm doing much better. Before I was 88 I think I was like 110. 2012-01-22 21:52:07 reddit post Why did you stop risperidone? What happened with your visual disturbances? I'm glad celexa works for you. It does well with people, that and Lexapro. They're supposed to be very similar. I don't remember exactly why I got off of Lexapro but I took it two separate times so there must be a reason I went through withdrawal hell twice for it. 2012-01-22 21:27:56 reddit post Yeah, this is the first time I haven't been on a combo. When I first started I was taking lots at once. Usually Lamictal + antidepressant + Buspar or Adderall + benzo. I liked to say I was taking an antidepressant, depressant, stimulant, and mood stabilizer because it just sounded funny like that. It's nice I suppose that I only have to take Lamictal right now, but it's not enough. Hopefully increasing in the future will help. I'm happy to hear that you're okay with realizing you'll be on antidepressants for the rest of your life. I think me too. It's only really helped. 2012-01-22 13:14:13 reddit post I used to have a dream of taking pictures for a living. Now I kind of want to paint but not really, I just say it. Translating emotion visually is so great. I once had a bad grade in a photo class and never wanted to take photos again. That stuff doesn't matter anymore. It's very nice to know someone who was suicidal still takes nat geo photos. That was my goal once, to go into the wild and take photos, that sort of thing. That dream job sort of thing. I forgot about it. Thank you. 2012-01-22 13:10:57 reddit post I am also 19 and have an interest in indirect suicide. Very different from you, though. Sorry to add in some bullshit diagnosis but being bipolar with rapid cycling can make people feel this way. The death obsession with depression and the energy to do it with mania. But anyways, I don't think death will help. It just numbs you. Being numb is so addicting. I bet especially so with your lifestyle... craving that feeling of finally feeling numb. It's like finding peace but much more tragic. I hope these other people's words help. I just understand that indirect suicide thing, I've never been suicidal but I've not wanted to live plenty of times. Like, eh fuck eating, too much work to keep myself in this condition. I'm not trying to say you'll be fixed one day but I think one day you'll find this thing where you'll like a thing. I don't know what thing. I'm obsessed with kittens and I don't have one but they keep me going. It's fucking stupid but they saved me and I can save a kitten too which is pretty cool. One day. 2012-01-22 12:59:34 reddit post I do this when I've been alone for a few hours, to the point of breaking down crying. I'm definitely not trying to 1up you, saying I have it worse at all. But just a small thing, I have been getting better. My boyfriend was sick and house sitting his moms place (we have a dog that can't come) so I went and slept the night. I had no one and I actually enjoyed myself. I also have driving anxiety and she lives in a hilly area with small streets. One year ago I couldn't have done this. Being alone for 5 minutes made me sad (boyfriend pooping for instance??) a year ago. I could not imagine being alone for a few days. And I have complete social anxiety to almost agoraphobia. Scumbag brain at it's worst (for me). 2012-01-22 12:55:49 reddit post This is good. I'm in the middle of college and my (abnormal) psychology professor said that it's okay to take school slowly. She has a PhD so it's nice to get the validation. She said she believed in me getting a PhD, but not now. That was last year. I need something like this. I'm on break from school, no job, so I'm getting no external validation (money or grades) to know how well I'm doing. Anyone saying anything I'm doing fine is lying to me. Watching things like Intervention I say things like, Oh My God these people need immediate help. People say, No I need my daughter! And not even having a child I feel so funny saying these people need help, and I can't even take a month off of self care. Whether in the hospital, whatever. I don't need that now, I'm a year past that point, but really... It's extremely hard to judge not seeing how bad your situation is from your perspective. This is a great little comic. 2012-01-22 12:50:48 reddit post I've been sleeping 14 hours, and then naps in between. I took 2 naps today outside of the sleep. Before being medicated, I would be so stressed I would sleep because it's like finally being able to take a break. It must be part of the relief of suicide. I'm not suicidal but goddamn I need sleep. Which makes me not eat and made me 88 pounds but fuck it, maybe it's all a slow death. I'm wondering if it's related to compulsive overeating, but compulsive oversleeping. I'm bored, I sleep. I'm happy, I sleep. I'm anxious, I sleep. I'm nauseous, I sleep. 2012-01-22 12:45:34 reddit post A few days ago I had a panic thing because I heard a song I listened to in middle school. It happens a lot from that time period, when my depression started. I think it's because its such a "losing child innocence" stage in my life. It sucked because I was about to get laid, and I did but it was probably a pity lay, since I haven't heard back from her. She was also a brand new 18 year old lesbian and I'm a 19 year old lezbo grandma (just kidding) but it's like, fuck this is supposed to be sexy. But all I did was cry. I can't smell and I've heard people find smells nostalgic. But there is something quite tragic in nostalgia. I never compare the word nostalgia to something that is happy. It's always a longing. And in depression, I do long. 2012-01-22 12:41:00 reddit post I always thought it was interesting how death was connected to my depression. I always thought, I'm not suicidal but I certainly wouldn't mind if I died. Killing myself would take too much work and planning that I just don't have the energy to do. It might be a reason I had anorexia, because I would just not have the energy to feel myself (amongst other things). I always felt like the suicidal ones must be bipolar (or fast cycling). I understand. I'm dealing with it by getting my dopamine hits. Small little doses of things that not necessarily bring me excitement (so hard), but just the little things that give me a little zap. It's how (recreational) drugs probably work. This would just be more "natural" and more fit to you. Hobbies are so hard to think of now, at least for me. I feel pressure to do well in a hobby. So things like reddit (obviously) help. Anything to get you high as long as it isn't directly damaging (things that'll get your adrenaline or endorphins up... unless it's exercise. But unhealthy sex, vomiting, drugs, although they help temporarily, don't really help in the end). With my own personality, it's the things that people make fun of that work for me. People say it's stupid to show a depression person a picture of a kitten, but I've always been an animal nerd since a tiny girl. I don't consider it a hobby, since animals don't judge. Perhaps find something like that. People often say charity helps with that but don't worry about that yet. But have that mindset in the back of your brain. Or stupid things like self help books even help. I love the DBT workbook (it's green). Different from CBT but it basically gives you lists you can do without judging you. You can have a "fuck it, fuck life" thing too, like.. "fuck i'm going to run to the grocery store and not giving a shit" helps. Like that same anger that comes from "fuck life" but different. The point isn't to make you happy at this point, but for little steps. I don't even know what I'm saying. I understand completely though. Someone out there is going through the same things, sometimes dealing with it worse. Wanting and asking for help is such an important step. Jeez, I keep sounding like some piece of shit article. I don't mean it like that. Just... it gets better. I feel better than I did 1 year ago. I can make it seem like that means it's been a year since I've only improved a little, but I'm changing my mindset to be like... I showered today, which is better than me not showering yesterday. Just small stuff. What has been on your list of medications? I want to hear your (chemical) journey. 2012-01-22 12:24:16 reddit post I'm sure a lot of us are here right in the middle of what I'm going through, which is finding the right meds. I thought it might be interesting to compare what we might be taking. --- Me: I got off Cymbalta because I slept all day. I got off Wellbutrin because it made my anxiety worse (I also have GAD and panic disorder). I got off Lexapro because it was expensive, sexual side effects, and I wasn't sure if it was working. I got off of Paxil CR because I slept 14 hrs per day and spent that time with nightmares every day, but it did help with anxiety and depression. I got off of Buspar because I don't think it did anything except when I stopped taking it my anxiety was bad. I got off of Adderall because it made my heart rate consistently 120+ bpm. Another reason I stopped Wellbutrin. I took Strattera for like a month for some reason. I've taken Lamictal and it helped with stopping my meltdowns becoming extreme. I'm on 200mg, increasing to 300mg and I've been on it for 2 years. I take xanax and klonopin on the side. I've just been switched to taking Paxil 5mg, from Paxil CR 25mg. I think it's mostly placebo. I'm currently in the withdrawal stages of Paxil and I've been feeling bed bound, overwhelmed with everything from the physical side effects, and emotional, too. I seem to do really badly with withdrawals, from nausea and dizziness and brain zaps and panic and eventually vomiting from stress of nausea. I'm sick of always being in withdrawal, because otherwise I don't seem to get that sick. I know there are lots of medications that I haven't tried, but before I've at least I had an idea of what meds I should take next. I often suggest them to my doctors, since I've done my research. For example, when I went off of Adderall, I suggested Wellbutrin to help with the ADHD. The only thing that I know has worked is Lamictal, and only since I hit 200mg. CBT-based therapy helped around this time as well. I know many people have much longer lists than I do, and many more treatment options, and I'm curious about them all. What was your step after trying out SSRIs, for example? I'm especially curious about (atypical) antipsychotics and things of that sort. 2012-01-22 07:04:55 reddit post I love how delicate your body is. So sexy. Also I think I have same/similar undies. Yay :D 2012-01-22 06:38:31 reddit post I'd say the dykey bits :) There's a bit of a difference in the subreddits both link to on the sidebar! The gorgeous Freja Beha 2012-01-22 03:36:11 reddit post 2012-01-21 12:40:24 reddit post the movie "our idiot brother". ahh rashida jones in this is SO cute! i read recently that the stylist dressed her as a boy he would be attracted to. 2012-01-20 05:59:55 reddit post I'll have to see about the leather, as someone said in this thread about cloth being more sanitary when it comes to multiple partners, being able to sanitize. We both love leather, so it'll be a hard decision. Or not. Maybe both will happen. :) If i do get cloth though, it won't be a cheap one. What you said makes a lot of sense. That leather one really is beautiful. I have an njoy fun wand that I've used on him (gently!) and he took that pretty well... Although, it didn't go in much, I suppose he was more okay with the circumference... hm, I didn't really think about that until now. 2012-01-20 05:48:28 reddit post Thanks! I love that purple one, although I think it would be too large for my boyfriend's first. Maybe just for myself when I get the money :P It's not the g-spot I'm worried about, but general friction, and it doesn't seem to be because of lube for me, since even when I do use synthetic lube I still feel pain after a short while. It's very odd, I can do anal sex much more "successfully" than vaginal. Do you know if a low riding harness would add extra stimulation to the vulva? Since I do like pressure on the mound/lower tummy... I suppose things like this are for me to find out with my own body! Anyways, thank you so much! I love the internet. 2012-01-20 03:28:47 reddit post I appreciate you taking time out of class to write this! It definitely helps. The cloth idea definitely sounds good, for cleaning reasons. I've seen some great looking cloth ones too. I don't necessarily need a sparkly dildo, just to explain how I want it in the general gist of things. :P I always thought I wanted a double ended dildo, but I'm not sure anymore since my vagina gets overstimulated pretty easily. Is there a problem with that? I can imagine it might bother my urethra as well, since it would be in the middle of all the stimulation. 2012-01-19 20:47:10 reddit post I suppose I was listing reasons to not have sex in the dark to make an orgy better. So, I listed the analogy to add to the confusion of protection. 2012-01-19 14:06:58 reddit post i am proud to say that i am not into bestiality. 2012-01-19 14:04:34 reddit post right now i'm writing on ambien with no glasses on so i might speak a little out of order but i have insomnimania so its ok. i mean like, let's say in a group of hot people, let's use the stupid rating system, of people from 8-10. of course you want to touch 9 and 10, but the 8s you're less likely to want to touch. maybe, to me, it feels like a high school dance? like.. "id go out with those skaters, except that one" but when it comes to orgies, you have to be like... the chance of you being with someone you don't want to be already messes the flow in your head. unless they're all identical twins. no one has the same amount of trust and know each other with everyone. oof. if you want, you can ask me specifically and i can respond better once I sleep. 2012-01-19 13:59:54 reddit post oh. yeah. nitrous oxide, not those cute spindly things. 2012-01-19 13:58:00 reddit post I'm not so into vibrators. Maybe I just need the whole shbang hitachi, but it's a little boring to me. maybe having to adjust, and not having it lost, and when is it time to stop using it, and i hope the dog doesn't get to it if it fell of the bed... (disclaimer: i have generalized anxiety :P) but even without those thoughts, it arouses me like 3 out of 10 at best. 2012-01-19 13:51:38 reddit post Yeah, that wiring thing you described is great. It really is just as if touch has a different sensation. there can be ones that have no sharpness. It takes a pretty good understanding of how it works (which I don't have that well down) but being on the receiving end of it, I don't like any pain related. I had probes in v and ass and since so much surface area was being touched, it basically was a low gentle vibrator. Another cool thing is using props like wiring through the dom's body to a whip with metals inside, or vampire gloves... kissing is great too, touching tongues with that little tickle in between. also, the adrenaline of the entire experience. I don't think i could ever come to it, and maybe not have it be sexual but more sensual. 2012-01-19 13:46:00 reddit post Protection, but someone once told me that there's also the one person in the group you most likely do not want to have sex with. That person that might be fuckable when you're drunk. 2012-01-19 13:42:34 reddit post Haha, same with me except instead of pizza it was whippets so basically it was just a big strange movie. Then I went to the kitchen and got some snacks and went back in and wanted more whippets. This was the first time I did whippets and it's still my favorite little thing. I was naked though and I love being naked but it's more of one of those bachelor things where I poke my boobs while watching TV and not wearing undies so I can do push laundry day to another day and there's some background moans going on somewhere. 2012-01-19 13:37:56 reddit post I agree. I think a lot of people see being able to be with a girl as an experience that will most likely be purely sexual and short-lived. It wasn't until I was fully aware that I was bisexual instead of wanting to "experiment" and letting myself check out girls and be open to be with a girl in a long term relationship that I loved to have sex with girls. Not to say I don't love casual sex with girls too. God I love fucking girls. This is fun to talk about. It makes me want to come out to the whole world. "Here's your groceries" "Thanks I love girls". Luckily the internet cares less about me saying things like that so boobies boobies boobies 2012-01-19 13:31:33 reddit post Same! There's a part of me that might feel self conscious, but it doesn't explain not finding pleasure in receiving. I think for me it has to do with liking a broad surface area. I love grinding, for instance, and can / prefer to come with my undies still on (not having to do with the self consciousness). I get overstimulated much too quickly. One of the reasons I can last longer with anal sex than vaginal. Receiving oral is kind of boring to me though. 2012-01-19 13:27:21 reddit post while there is an aspect of fearing of being a voyeur, i don't feel that way in threesomes. i guess it helps the small bit of exhibitionist in me, even though i'm usually the one to give. i suppose there's always room to touch... there's actually more available areas :P mouths, genitalia, holding hands, whatever. i've never been in a foursome, but to me it sounds like it might as well be an orgy or 2 couples having sex in the same room. totally personal preference though, since i'm not attracted by the idea of orgies or orgies i've been in the same room with. although, when i have been in a room where an orgy has been going on, i want to cling to my boyfriend even more, so maybe that's what the not feeling left out thing comes in. also sorry for the skipping around of this, ambien writing..! 2012-01-19 13:20:44 reddit post you're focused on the dynamics of things, which is fine when there's someone who clearly knows what they're doing / are experienced / are a good top. that's "easier", at least. i've been in ones where it's basically 2 girls pleasing the guy, and the encounter was all very casual. it was good but afterwards it's like, eh i could've done without it. recently i've been doing ones where it's mostly like me and a girl playing, and i'm also paying attention to my boyfriend, but the 3rd is more like a toy. this is important to me since i'm more on the lesbian side of the spectrum at the moment. it was also not sex based, but like... cuddling extreme, where there was no pressure for orgasm. of course, the individuals is what makes the dynamic work, even when its 2 people. it's just more to think about with 3 people. i don't think it has to do with jealousy (and i can be jealous, just not in 3somes i suppose). i think there's more pressure to "perform" in general. 2012-01-19 10:07:47 reddit post I'll keep all of those in mind, especially the first one. I haven't even thought of that (mixing and matching). There's so many options... I thought, well of course I want high quality! But realized my boyfriend might not like it at all. As with all sex toys, I suppose. I'm definitely going to a store after all of this browsing. I don't think I can tell well enough what is considered high quality. 2012-01-19 09:10:40 reddit post That position is great if you need a large surface area, which sounds like what your friend is looking for, unless it really is just the texture. I'm similar in that I need a large surface area, and I love being on top (physically, not mentally). I masturbated while grinding on pillows, so I find that position to be the easiest to come to. Another good one is grinding against the partner's thigh, or that position which is grinding against the pubic bone which can be done without internal stimulation if that can be uncomfortable. I'm buying a strap-on for the first time and need advice! 2012-01-19 08:52:13 reddit post So, for my birthday (in March), my boyfriend is going to buy me a strap-on for me to use on him (and the ladies I get to fuck every once in a while!) (which happened last night btw I'm happy for getting laid, A+). I'm trying to research them but I have no idea where to start, and thought I'd ask my fellow redditors. Are there any cult brands that I should know about (like njoy toys)? I'm a small/thin girl, is there a specific thickness of harness that is known to be more comfortable? What about harness materials? For the guys, especially the hetero ones: is there anything you can add about your experience with them? My boyfriend likes prostate stimulation but not penetration. We have an aneros but find that fingers work nicer. Is an extra small dildo helpful? Is one that gives a bend nicer? What would seem the least intimidating? Some things I've got down is that I wouldn't like it to look realistic in terms of color and details and would love a pink girly glittery cock with hearts and stars and rainbows, at least for now. Help! 2012-01-17 01:25:25 reddit post i say either a very rich/dark red or brunette, i think too bright of red or too dark of black will make complexions look worse. not absolutely sure though! but i'm sure you can pull a lot off, the haircut suggestion above sounds great. 2012-01-15 08:29:11 reddit post Honestly, try Kewpie mayo. Mentioned a few times here. It makes a world of a difference. 2012-01-15 08:28:28 reddit post Would it be like itadakimasu? 2012-01-15 08:26:40 reddit post Growing up with only Kewpie mayo, regular mayo disgusts me! Thank god I live by a Japanese market. It's much smoother and creamier than other mayo. Regular mayo is like Kraft cheese next to Kewpie. Also... thanks for the recipe, OP. Simple recipes of things I already have is one of the greatest feelings. Makes me feel like my kitchen is well stocked even with an empty fridge. 2012-01-14 07:12:33 reddit post this made me excited :) i saw your boys undies post the other day and went off to go look for some. i love boys undies. 2012-01-12 13:08:29 reddit post There are some varying definitions, like the person not being able to stay at least 85% of their ideal body weight, and the refusal to gain. There's also the difference between Anorexia Nervosa and anorexia, which is just about a loss of appetite. They used the term very casually which is upsetting for an article that is trying to convey an accurate measurement of what "normal" is. 2012-01-12 12:49:44 reddit post I'm in that situation right now. I love my boyfriend, but I'm also free to explore girls while he stays monogamous to me (by both our choices). There are plenty of girls out there who are willing to fulfill your girly-needs. For me, one of the top priorities in being with a girl is someone who is okay with me being with a man. This girl doesn't sound like the greatest addition to your relationship. If she already isn't okay with it, I'd be worried she would be jealous in the future, so you have to be very careful if you do plan on moving forward with her, and she gives the OK for some reason. My personal advice would be to move on, though. 2012-01-12 10:48:32 reddit post i agree, though... the undies look so soft. cuddling you would be like hugging a kitten with hearts all over it while eating a cupcake, i think! 2012-01-12 10:20:22 reddit post i have scars in the same area. it was surprising to see. you're beautiful 3 One of these things is not like the others 2012-01-12 01:59:42 reddit post 2012-01-11 05:09:56 reddit post i don't think she's "ruined", but since plastic surgery often has similar results (noses end up looking similar, etc), i'm not sure i could recognize if i saw her in public. she just blends in more. 2012-01-11 01:40:55 reddit post are you... serious? 2012-01-08 12:02:44 reddit post i have that color right now, different answer. i'm in the process of going white, but to take a break in between bleachings, i went a light pink. so the bleach is yellow, and "cotton candy pink" in manic panic mixed in with conditioner works. i also didnt wash my hair for a few days before the dye, so it rinsed out quickly... but its a very easy color to maintain otherwise, for a light color. mostly because you don't have to worry about toning. 2012-01-08 11:15:44 reddit post this. my back hurts just looking at it. 2012-01-08 07:54:48 reddit post thank you! she's such a gorgeous 2012-01-08 07:52:14 reddit post [portia de rossi!](http://www4.images.coolspotters.com/photos/1380/portia-de-rossi-and-iggy-pop-lust-for-life-t-shirt-gallery.jpg) i also vote her and ellen as [cutest couple ever](http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxa4rr4TSy1qixsnco1_500.jpg) 2012-01-07 04:42:01 reddit post i wanna join in on the fun!

I'm not blind, but I've never been able to smell. I loved the image of the lady whose head is a flower, and I didn't realize it related to my lack of smell until I showed it to my boyfriend. It helped me understand why someone would like to wear perfume, in a visual image, instead of just saying "oh, it smells good". 2011-12-23 12:27:14 reddit post your excited response made me watch it. this, and i like princesses and jellyfish... i've been watching this on hulu since you posted. i'm about halfway done. i'm not even that big of an anime fan either. thank you! 2011-12-23 12:26:14 reddit post what does make character design for you, then? 2011-12-21 10:35:42 reddit post i understand that feeling, being (half) asian, and young. but it's totally about your self esteem. any girl could say that a guy is flirting with her just to bang her, etc. 2011-11-22 09:35:47 reddit post There was also a tutorial around Halloween around here using jello inside straws to make jello-worms and they said they ran the straws under hot water for a little bit and they slid out. 2011-11-21 22:30:16 reddit post It depends on what kind of art. I've noticed younger artists (probably a background in illustration) have cheaper art, ~$300. I like Gallery WWA in Culver City, they had a little back room filled with art when I went which I'm sure is still there. 2011-11-12 01:38:14 reddit post stress/weight loss can do this as well. the hair cycles every 3 months, so if your stress was from 3 months ago, this sounds right. you could be stress-free now, but your hair is still 3 months behind. 2011-11-10 23:37:38 reddit post i was thinking omurice (omlette-rice), as well. 2011-11-08 20:19:48 reddit post kcgjlc;iug kick_luigi 2011-11-05 10:23:40 reddit post I can't say exact citations or anything, but it reminds me of something I read recently about being surprised. That is, humans become surprised when there's a sudden change in scenery, like light or sound or object. Obviously to protect from predators and etc etc. So the "fight or flight" mode would turn on during these times. With a commercial/jump cut, there's a bunch of sudden changes, but I guess it becomes a positive reaction instead of negative. Kind of like how tickling stems from pain is what I'm guessing, and how people like horror movies. 2011-10-26 08:51:05 reddit post you can put purple in without rebleaching :) it would be different if you wanted to go, say, pink. but you could go purple or aqua-green really easily. there's some other tips out there. some people recommend dying every 1-2 weeks... it's easier because you can put the blue over your black hair and it won't dye it. you can rinse out with vinegar to keep from fading. you can also mix the dye with a conditioner to keep in your hair while you shower. also, dark pillowcases! i love hair dye :P 2011-10-19 21:42:44 reddit post Is it? His recipe is still [here](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/beef-jerky-recipe/index.html). I don't remember what was in the 2nd half, but that's all you really need to know. 2011-10-19 06:33:38 reddit post Saw his stuff through Gallery 1988's newsletter, too. 2011-10-19 01:05:53 reddit post Even cheaper is using a box fan instead of a dehydrator. [Alton Brown explains.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIK4DVLHf7Y) 2011-10-14 12:04:06 reddit post i don't know if it's just me, but she looks like michelle from skins too! 2011-10-01 23:19:31 reddit post trying to recover from anorexia nervosa right now (and always). this one quote my nutritionist said sticks with me: "Telling someone with an eating disorder to eat is like telling someone in a wheelchair to get up and walk." other addictions, in my opinion, get easier with time. i'm not so sure this is the same for anorexia. 2011-09-27 17:27:17 reddit post this is what kept me from learning how to drive, although i finally did a year ago. it was especially sneezing i was afraid of. i get too much anxiety in a two-lane. too much! 2011-09-23 21:46:09 reddit post the same is happening to me right now. i had $4k out of high school, but in less than a year, got down to under $100 (from no job). finally got myself a job, and my bank account is $600-ish. this is with my parents helping me, too, though. 2011-09-05 00:37:05 reddit post I'm trying to gain weight as well, and see a nutritionist. There are a lot of great ideas here that I'll keep in mind (thanks again, Reddit!) I eventually got really tired of eating nuts and avocados and heavy things, so I recently found that juice is helpful. A glass of juice can have as many calories as milk (just not as much protein). Eating a lot can get tiring, at least for me, so variety is the most important thing. I recently got a crockpot, too. Throw in a bunch of beans, seasoning (bouillon, curry spices, etc), eat it with some rice. Cheap as all hell. Mixed beans, lentils, split peas... throwing in frozen veggies are an easy way to make it interesting, too.

The doctors are 95% sure it is cancerous. Fuck. I recently joined the National Guard (September 2014) and haven't even gone to Basic or AIT yet (I ship out in a few months). I've been at an RSP unit since September. They say it is a easily treatable form of cancer and that I should be fine, but all I care about is if it will force me to get medically discharged? I planned on doing ROTC at my college and going active duty after that as well so will this have any effect on that? My MOS is 31B if that changes anything.

[Build Ready] Here we go, my build is finalized (again) hopefully for the last time. 2015-02-02 22:20:21 reddit post I was hoping some of y'all could look over my build. I had a build all set up with SLI GTX970's but the VRAM issue turned me off to it. I have since decided to go with a single GTX980 and SLI it with another GTX980 or a GTX980Ti (if it will ever exist) in the future. I have explored my options with other cards, namely the AMD R9 290(X) in Crossfire, but have settled on the GTX980, with plans to SLI with it in the future. For now, it will be run off of a 1080p 60Htz HDTV, so its definitely overkill, but I plan on upgrading to a 1440p or 4K monitor in the future, and will probably SLI at the same time. My main goal was to run games at 1080p and ~70 fps.

I was originally going to use a i5 4690k, but since I wasn't ever planning on OCing, I went with the i7. Plus it's hyperthreading will be used for engineering stuff. **Motherboard** I chose this motherboard because it matches my color scheme I am going for and has more than enough of the features I'll need. **Memory** I went with 8gb since I'm on a budget and couldn't fit any more in. I chose 1x8 so I have more room to upgrade in the future. I know 2x4 would be better performance but I want to be able to upgrade to 32gb later to use some as a Ram disk. **Storage** Pretty standard stuff. I chose a well reviewed 256gb SSD and a well review 1 TB HDD. It is more than enough space for me. **GPU** Its expensive, but its a great card. I chose the MSI Twin Frozr GTX980 since it has the best all round performance. I love how it shuts off its fans when its idle. Probably not the best price-wise but I think its worth it **PSU** Its a well reviewed PSU and is just enough for SLI GTX980's **OS** Doesn't really matter what I have since I'll be upgrading to Windows 10 when it is released. **Wireless Network Adapter** Its cheap and allows me to use Wi-Fi. **Case** I have arranged with a guy on /r/hardwareswap to buy this case and 3x Noctua NF F-12 case fans for $110. (Case $70 + Fans $40). Very good deal for me IMO. Should be a beast of a build. Probably a bit overkill and it just barely fits in my price range.

Internally, it has a reshimmed G amp;amp;P gearbox and a 6.03mm tightbore.It also has a brand new SHS hop up and bucking. This thinks shoots insanely well. It is full metal and comes with a mock suppressor, a Surefire Scout Mini (and two batteries), a Red Dot scope (with red/green and multiple dot styles to choose from) a 300rd high cap, and an 11.1v lipo.

It shoot ~375-390 fps **I am asking ~~$250 shipped OBO Now $175+shipping**~~ **Now $145+ shipping** Does not come with Surefire. It was parted out and sold. I have a brand new **CYMA M14 Socom** in black. This thing was never used and has had less than 200 rounds shot through it. It was literally opened, tested to make sure it worked and then never used again. It comes with one high cap magazine. The red dot sight in the pictures is not included.

My main concern is the cooler I chose. I do not know if it will be able to handle the increase during overclocking. Will it to maybe to 4.0-4.5ghz? I chose the Asus MoBo mainly because it was cheapish and is SLI capable. I plan to buy a second GPU in the future. I don't see anything that could interfere with the build in regards to this motherboard, but does anyone see anything? The GPU I chose is kinda straightforward. Its a Gigabyte G1 Windforce. No foreseen problems here, as I made sure it will fit in my case. Speaking of cases, I chose the Corsair Vengeance C70 in Black. I wanted something that looked heavy duty and military-esque and this fit the bill perfectly. My main gripe is there are only two USB ports on the front, but that's a minor issue. I chose 16GB of ram because I like to overcompensate. Pretty much the only reason. Same with the PSU I chose. Overcompensation. I probably don't need 750w, but I'm going to SLI in the future, so I guess its better to buy one powerful enough now so I dont't have to spend more in the future. I chose a well rated SSD and a good 1 TB HDD for storage. I probably won't need that much space. My current laptop has a 250GB HDD and I haven't even filled it halfway in the five years I've had it. Last of all, I need the wi-fi card because I am too far away from my router to hook up directly. Before I pull the trigger, does anyone see any glaring issues or problems? Will I need any more wires? Are the C70's stock case fans good enough? Should I switch to a CPU water cooler? I was looking at Corsairs liquid cpu coolers, but I'm unsure. Plus my case has a spot on top for a radiator and it feels like a shame to let it go unused. Anyone know wher I can get 8gb RAM sticks cheaper? I couldn't find any. [Build Ready]My First Build.

I've grown up around them and shooting them. That being said, I'm about to turn 18 in a few days and am looking to get an AK pattern rifle. Currently, I (or rather my father) own a Tikka T3 Lite and a Winchester Hunting Shotgun (they're my firearms but technically are owned by my father since I'm 17). I've mainly used them for hunting and shooting skeet, but now I am looking to get a rifle that's semi automatic and is more of a "modern" rifle than my T3. I was looking at a AK pattern rifle in either .556 or .308 and was wondering if it's possible and if anyone knows where I could get a rifle that takes STANAG mags or 7.62 SR-25/AR mags that's also an AK pattern. I was looking at VEPRs and Saigas and thinking of doing a conversion. Any thoughts?

Something like a MBSS/MAP [Wtb] Molle Hydration Pack 2014-12-18 04:14:00 reddit post Looking for something similar to an MBSS or MAP pack. Does not have to be specifically hydration, just a pack that can attach to molle vests. Also, anyone know what the name of the medical backpack the assault class in Battlefield 3 uses? I'm also interested in one of those if anyone has one.

[](/bjshake) Defender vs. Discovery I/II/III vs. Range Rover Classic 2014-12-03 03:10:32 reddit post I've been looking at Rovers recently and I am a bit curious to which you think is better for off-road/overland type stuff that can also be used as a daily driver. I live in the USA, so obviously Defenders are few and far between unless I import one, which is a pain in the ass with the 25 year limit. I like the loons of the Defender a lot more than the Discovery, but is there any significant difference in off-road ability, other than the V8 in the Discovery vs. the Diesel in the Defender? Despite their rarity of parts in the US, I am still leaning toward a Defender because of their Diesel engines and looks, but I cannot find of they are importable into the US with the diesel? Also just watched the Top Gear Bolivia special and I was surprised by Clarkson's Range Rover. I never really considered them mainly due to me thinking they were just sissy luxury SUVs, but obviously I was wrong. Any thoughts on them?

I'm really interested in 19K since it's a combat job and it has a enlistment bonus and kicker. Any tankers In the guard have any input or reason to do/not to do it?

It also has a rear locker, 35" BFGs, and a rebuilt 22re motor with 5k miles on it. but the owner says that it needs a front axel seal (it has a solid front axel) and a front U- joint installed. He says it still drives in 2w d fine, but I'm worried about the cost and skills needed. Are those difficult parts to install and is that something I can do without any special tools? Also would it be a bad idea to drive it without those parts installed? Off Day + Running Diet Questions 2014-11-03 00:33:30 reddit post First of all, I searched and couldn't find any answers to this.

Should I apply to colleges now as well, or wait until I am in the Guard? Also, do I have to use the GI Bill while in the Guard, or is there a special guard scholarship?

I also need a new inner barrel. I will also take a M16 + suppressor length barrel if someone sells me a suppressor, which I also need. I'd like to keep it fairly inexpensive, but if the offers right, I'll take anything. I would really like a DD 12" rail that is used on the M4 Block II [WTT][WTS] Cyma M14 Socom, JG G36C 2014-06-25 06:35:43 reddit post I would really like to get rid of these guns. I have no use for them and all they've done is sit around. I will trade for almost anything if I like it, so offer away. **JG G36C** Pics: http://imgur.com/a/0fZJR This gun is nearly brand new. It has ~300 rounds through it total. This is the new version that was released shortly before JG among other companies were forced to cease production of H amp;amp;amp;K style airsoft guns due to copyright infringement or something along those lines. It will come with two(2) 350 rd JG high cap magazines. I will sell for $100 OBO **Cyma M14 SOCOM** Pics: http://i.imgur.com/EZ8XDOG.jpg This gun is almost brand new as well and has no external issues or internal issues whatsoever. Even the bolt works along with the working bolt release. It shoots ~350 FPS. It will come with one(1) 350 rd Cyma high cap magazine.

[WTS][WTT] JG G36c New Version 2014-06-24 03:18:14 reddit post I have a near new G36c that I am looking to trade or sell, although I prefer trades. I really don't know what I want for it trade wise, so offer anything. AEG, GBB, I don't care. I would really like an M249, MK48 or M60, though, but obviously the G36 is worth less compared to those so I could throw in some money as well. And as I said, offer anything. The gun only has about 300 rounds through it and has never been used in a game. It will come with two JG 350rd high caps. Keep in mind that this gun is discontinued because of the cease and desist from Umarex/ H amp;amp;amp;K so you likely wont see many of near new ones around much longer. Pics: http://imgur.com/a/0fZJR I would really prefer trades but I'd sell it for $130 OBO. I can take PAYPAL or USPS money order Edit: I also have a CYMA M14 SOCOM I would like to sell/trade Pic: http://i.imgur.com/EZ8XDOG.jpg Similar condition to G36 but has only had ~100 rounds through it. Almost brand new. I traded for it new about a year ago. Solid gun, amazing range, comes with one 350rd high cap.

I tried spraying it, but apparently it was old, so it just dribbled down onto my hand, so I threw it away and washed my hands. Apparently washing my hands didn't get it all off, so when I tried pissing later, it got on my dick and now it feels like my dick is in fire. TL;DR Got pepper spray on my dick. It burns.

I have acquired his help and thus we as the mafia gain an extra kill. He is confirming my identity with /u/DangerPulse in order to make sure my alt is mafia aligned. I think that this is a great opportunity because we have to give him no Mafia members names and we get an extra kill. We run no risk of being exposed either. I will update as the situation develops but it seems likely I can work out a deal with him. What should I do. I received these PMs. I don't want to screw us over. 2014-01-05 05:56:13 reddit post Something chart... 2014-01-02 05:41:08 reddit post Thanks Why do I see so much hate on here for Rise Against? 2013-12-15 02:42:42 reddit post They were the first punk I heard and I always liked their music, but then I come to this sub and see that many people don't like them.

Then I went and forced myself to run 7-8 miles about three weeks ago and ever since then I've been getting an average of an 24 minute 5k. That is unacceptable to me.

I don't know why, but I made a post on /r/army asking something about contracts and one of them went through my history and starting pulling things out of context and telling me that they don't think I'm Special Operations or Ranger material just on the context of me being a Brony. Bullshit. I've been training myself for the past 4 years and they know nothing of who I am. This was demoralizing at the least. I really thought that my nations soldiers would be better than the average asshole on Reddit but apparently not. And for you guys on /r/Army who will undoubtedly go through my history again. Why do you give a shit what I do with my life? I'm trying to do something good with my life and y'all are just bashing me for something completely unrelated. Sincerely, A demoralized and angry subject9229 Thank you everyone. You guys have helped me get a perspective on the whole thing. Edit: Me and the dude in question had a chat and I seem to have misunderstood him. He stereotyped me as being the sterotypical brony, which im not, and I said some things I shouldnt have. I hope he understands that it pissed me off, and is demoralizing when they guys you call your heroes tell you you can't do something. I can do anything I fucking want and will.

How hard is it to get an 18X or 11X Op 40 contract? I have wanted to be all I can be (not quoting army slogan, just telling it how it is) for quite some time and special forces or Ranger is the route I really want to take. I've talked to recruiters but they never gave me a straight answer. Edit: For all you making fun of me for how I live my life, go ahead I don't give a shit, I didn't ask for your opinion on how I live my life and I'll live my life how I want. I applied for a job. Yay. 2013-03-30 22:35:42 reddit post . Today I applied for a job at a hardware store. I have an interview next week and will probably get the job, because they need people to hire.

subject1637 2017-05-18 15:51:32 reddit post On #2, I think think the diversity felt natural instead of forced mostly because it wasn't limited to just a categories. There's not just diversity of race, but culture, sexuality, age, height/weight, disability status, mental health, even species and "life" (Reaper and Widow are basically undead). The cast is so wacky and outlandish that it doesn't come off as "pc" to most of us. The diversity seems like a by-product of the team trying to create the most crazy, larger-than-life characters possible. And to those who are part of an underrepresented minority, it's comforting to see a character who shares that status. 2017-05-15 03:23:09 reddit post Labels are for other people. 2017-05-09 19:59:41 reddit post FINALLY.

But what she really needs are some quality of life buffs. Translocator is hopelessly bugged, and nothing is more frustrating than dying *after* you teleport away. Her weapon spread is frustratingly high, such that I can uncloak 1m behind a half-health Junkrat and not be able to kill him. And hacking heroes just isn't enough utility to be worthwhile, except against a Rein. Not being able to hack Zarya while she's bubbled is annoying as hell. Does Tracer's blink "yo-yo" for anyone else? 2017-05-07 05:44:16 reddit post I'm not talking about lag (at least I don't think I am). I mean when you blink, you see the animation for the blink, and then the game reverts to *before* you blinked. For example, I'm like 10m away from a cluster of enemies, and I want to ult them. So I press "right click" then "q". I see my character blink (I move forward, lose 1 blink charge), then it yo-yo's back to before I blinked (I move back to my original position, gain 1 blink charge), then my character throws her pulse bomb. I'm not sure if I'm describing it clearly, but it's a frustrating and confusing bug that doesn't seem to fit the "Tracer's blink has a weird interaction with lag" explanation. Also, my internet connection is consistently pretty good (ping = ~35ms). I don't want to be that guy that blames all his failings on lag, but this bug is pretty noticeably affecting my performance.

In an IDE or something? Yes, I use Visual Studio. The only way I know how to "execute" a program is to run it in VS. you are in your second year and you don't know how to write code? The *code* I can do. It's the... everything else that I have trouble with. If I wrote that little "hello world" program in a txt file, yeah, I would have no idea what to do next. I'm embarrassed to ask my friends, and the professors just make me use Visual Studio.

Sometimes the material is difficult, yeah, but I enjoy the challenge. No, I feel lost because of how much *basic computer knowledge* I just don't have. And nobody's bothering to teach me. I know how to write programs, but nobody ever taught me to *program*. How do I turn a txt file into an executable? How do I run a program from the command line? How do I make the main function take input, such that I can run the program "on" a file? I ask these questions and I just get looks of "are you kidding me?" I'm not an idiot. Nobody was born with this knowledge. But I'm drowning because it seems like everyone is assuming that I have it, and I don't. 2017-05-04 08:23:07 reddit post Nah it's a gritty Les Miserables reboot. 2017-05-04 08:22:45 reddit post Something similar actually happened in real life! Spain was a fascist dictatorship under Franco, and Franco decided that his successor would be Prince Juan Carlos. To all the world, Juan Carlos seemed like the perfectly groomed absolute monarch: utterly devoted to Franco, and 100% expected to continue his legacy of ultraconservatism. Franco died, and Juan Carlos ascended to the throne. Within a year, Spain was a constitutional monarchy and power was concentrated in the parliament, not the throne. Turns out, ever since being chosen as Franco's successor, he had been secretly meeting with opposition leaders and planning the Spanish transition to democracy. Only when he was in full control of his country did he start dis-empowering the monarchist elements in the government. In a glorious triumph for democracy, he revealed that he had been *liberal all along.* 2017-05-04 03:21:28 reddit post Dude wtf now that's in my browser history. 2017-05-04 03:02:31 reddit post Try amphetamines!

The fact that my teleporter doesn't work *as an escape route* is infuriating. I know that if Sombra was OP she'd be really obnoxious, but fixing the translocator wouldn't do that; she'd be a bit harder to pin down, but then her agility would still be balanced. Tracer is and *will always be* a better mayfly character than Sombra. It's not going to unbalance her character if you change the translocator to make it *usable*. 2017-04-26 14:10:54 reddit post White, and none in particular.

I never get offered enough low-cost cards to play anything resembling an aggro deck. 2017-04-19 14:14:50 reddit post The biggest problem I have with the DC system is that penalties are levied on the player's SR for leaving. That might seem like a good idea, but in reality it causes the SR system to be less accurate. High-skill players who are toxic are penalized in rankings for leaving, which means that their next match is played with worse players, reinforcing their belief that *they* aren't the problem, *this team* is the problem. You get Gold-tier players in Bronze because they're toxic, and they keep being toxic because they genuinely are the best players on their teams. That makes those lower tiers more of an "ELO Hell". The ban/suspension system is great, and I've never had any complaints about it. But if players need to be punished for leaving, it shouldn't directly affect their SR any more than a game loss. Not because they don't deserve punishment, but because it makes the competitive environment worse for the rest of us. 2017-04-18 20:36:33 reddit post Nakedness in itself has a purpose Nakedness is the state of nature; it is how God made man. Before Eve, when man was solitary, he was naked. It's right to say that man has abused and misused nakedness, but that doesn't make it *inherently* sinful. The abuse of nakedness is a sin, not nakedness itself. Nakedness in itself outside of the bedroom is a sin according to the Bible. I'm curious about this. Do you have a source? 2017-04-18 20:25:52 reddit post I agree with the meat of what you're saying, and I do think that OP is trying to justify sinful behaviors because he doesn't want to admit it's sin. That said, I don't think we should resort to accusations of heresy. After all, any Christian of one denomination implicitly believes that all other denominations are heretical. In a Pan-Christian subreddit, it isn't conducive to learning and discussion. 2017-04-18 20:20:18 reddit post nakedness begets lust and therefore nakedness is to be avoided because it is a stumblingblock to the sinful mind. This is pretty much the same point OP is making though. Nakedness is not *inherently* sinful, but since it almost always causes lust (a sin) it generally ought to be avoided. I don't think it's fair to say that a man being naked with other men in a locker room is sinful, unless that man has *lustful* urges toward other men, and seeks out that situation. 2017-04-18 07:05:09 reddit post It's a papist thing.

I actually think this is better news for the GOP than the Democrats. This shows us that races can be safe on paper but *made* close by enthusiastic activism. 25 senate seats up for election are held by Democrats. Those races could go Republican in places like West Virginia, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota. The other 8 seats, currently held by Republicans, are very safe. Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Mississippi, Tennessee, Wyoming, and Nebraska. I'm not even sure the Dems are putting up a real fight in those states. But there are some Democrat-held seats that could be *made* close if the party concentrates our efforts. Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida; we can put up a fight there. 2017-04-12 16:43:46 reddit post 3v3 seems pretty healthy actually.

What you did was just a "dick move." Ultimately it's her fault, but you enabled it. 2017-04-11 23:05:44 reddit post Right, but if you want to convince a flat earther that the Earth is round, you can't expect to succeed by saying, "obviously the Earth is round, therefore you're wrong." You're invoking the fallacy of "begging the question," just assuming that an initial premise is correct and making the rest of your argument. I, for one, would like to hear the arguments for and against the claim that "children don't have self-ownership." 2017-04-11 16:21:50 reddit post This claim, for fairly obvious reasons, is uncontroversial. Evidently not, since the other commenter (an Ancap, towards whom the original post was aimed) seems to disagree with it. 2017-04-10 21:59:09 reddit post Speaking of, has anyone tried Menagerie Paladin yet? With Gentle Megasaur and Hydrologist, it seems good. 2017-04-10 02:17:00 reddit post Technically, no, not from a legal standpoint. From a moral standpoint, maybe. This really isn't a question of legality. The law should reflect the moral truth, either it is or is not a person. It's a gray area for me which is why I don't agree with it and would only consider it if there was some medical risk from carrying the baby to term (hypothetical, I am a guy). That's TOTALLY understandable. This is one of the most complex, nuanced questions in all of moral philosophy. I think the rights of the already living mother should come first simply because, well, we know she's a person. I *know* the fetus is a person. If you're unsure about whether the fetus is a person, you ought to either a) familiarize yourself with the arguments and make a decision, or b) recuse yourself from the debate. There's no shame in option b! There are plenty of things that we just elect not to care about, because each person has a limited amount of focus to devote to controversial issues. But the gut reaction to the abortion debate is generally the pro-choice view, because it's hard to see a single cell as a person. There is *so much more* ethical complexity to this, and our instincts really just can't be the basis of our views on this. 2017-04-10 00:36:16 reddit post This whole debate hinges on the personhood of the fetus, so do you consider the fetus to be a person or not? 2017-04-10 00:33:52 reddit post child-to-be Well if it's just a child-to-be then fine, no problem. Terminate if you don't want a baby, terminate if you got cold feet, hell terminate if you have an abortion fetish. If it's just a "child-to-be" then there is NO moral objection to abortion. But if you believe it isn't just a "child-to-be," but that it is instead a *person*, then it just doesn't make sense to support abortion's legality. 2017-04-10 00:31:31 reddit post So just to be clear... you believe abortion is murder, AND that abortion should be legal? 2017-04-10 00:27:35 reddit post but we shouldn't have people getting abortions and I won't be getting one. But why? What's your moral objection to abortion? 2017-04-09 18:34:00 reddit post I feel like Menagerie Paladin will be great in this set. Gentle Megasaur and Hydrologist push the murloc archetype, while also enabling Zoobot and Menagerie Magician. For dragons, we got Primordial Drake. You might even want to include Sated Threshedon as a 1-of. I've been fiddling with it and having some success. Winrate is 50/50 after 8 games, at rank 15. Anyone else try it out? 2017-04-09 18:30:40 reddit post I consider conception being when life starts. So then abortion is murder? This isn't the sort of thing where we can just say "oh everyone has their own opinion." It's literally life or death. If you *really* consider conception to be the start of life, and you *really* consider abortion to be murder, then how can you support it's legality? 2017-04-09 18:18:39 reddit post I am pro-life though. But *why*? Why do you have a moral objection to abortion, but not a legal one? 2017-04-09 17:23:11 reddit post At what point does the child's life matter to people on the right? Conception. There's a bit of debate here and there, but that's the general consensus. I'm actually enraged that someone would tell me that my safety is less concerning than infringing on someone's right to own a firearm. I'm a responsible gun owner, my guns are of no risk to anyone else. I'm not sure what you mean by this, or what comparison you're drawing. Could you elaborate? This isn't a left/right debate. It's authoritarian vs libertarian. The libertarian, even minarchist approach to abortion should still be pro-life. Only an anarchist philosophy would hold that murder should be legal. And anyways, that's a better dichotomy to draw. Authoritarianism is one end of the spectrum, anarchism is on the other. I think most people would agree that the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. 2017-04-07 13:50:39 reddit post I went 12-2 with Rogue last night. First 12-win run ever. Near the end of the night, I went up against players who were... less than exceptional. Game 14 ended when my opponent (Paladin) conceded on turn 4. I wasn't even playing aggro. I suspect that this poor performance was because a) it was 4:00 in the morning, and b) the expansion JUST came out. 2 Envenom weapons, Assassinate, and Vinespile Slayer makes for plenty of hard removal. Though in future I wouldn't recommend picking more than 1 Envenom Weapon; you're usually hitting some pretty big guys with it, so you take a lot of damage. Getting any use out of the second one is risky. 2017-04-07 11:21:43 reddit post 3-3 Warlock, 7-3 Mage, and I'm currently 5-1 with Rogue. Rogue's class cards this expansion are *very* good, I'm enjoying Vinespile Slayer. My mage run had a LOT of 2-drops and 3-drops. That might have just been an unusual run, but I had 19 cards that cost 3 or less. Fire Plume Phoenix is an MVP so far. Incredible value and versatility. If anyone has played Priest or Shaman, I'd like to hear your thoughts on those classes. Also, has anyone been offered/picked a quest? Are they even available to draft? 2017-04-05 17:40:36 reddit post Rein usually. Sometimes it's because nobody wants to play Mr. Big Blue Rectangle, sometimes it's because my team's Rein keeps charging into the enemy team solo. I main Tracer. Yesterday in comp I locked her in and someone in chat said to me, "hey you only have 2 hours on Tracer in comp, you should switch to Rein." Comp sucks sometimes. 2017-04-05 14:50:14 reddit post Snowball fights during winter! 2017-03-31 16:45:24 reddit post The fact that people who went to college tend to be liberal says more about college than it does about political philosophy. How many times have you encountered a *conservative* professor? How often are *conservative* political groups sponsored on campus? When's the last time your college invited a conservative to give a presentation? Higher education, as a whole, is liberal. Professors and institutions tend to be very left-wing. Additionally, they are set up in a structure that frames them as the "educator." Students are inclined to listen to and learn from their teachers. Thus, it is only natural that people tend to be more liberal after college. Additionally, A lot of conservative views tend to be based off of gut-instinct rather than a logical evaluation of how a policy will affect the average American. I grew up on conservative talk radio, and let me assure you that this is EXACTLY what they think of liberals. 2017-03-31 02:25:46 reddit post It's a shame [[Alhammarret's Archive]] isn't still in Standard, because this would've been great in my old deck. 2017-03-30 21:22:22 reddit post Congrats! I've been in this for about a year now, played DOZENS of arenas and my best is still 11. 2017-03-30 19:34:42 reddit post This is what you agree to by choosing to enjoy the benefits of living there. I was born here. I didn't make any choices. But in no way is taxation a moral theft; it is the payment that you must make to benefit from the advantages your country provides. Payment without consent *is* theft. And just because I can avoid getting robbed by moving elsewhere doesn't mean it isn't theft. I think taxes are a great deal! Pay, what, 20% of my income to be protected by the most powerful military in the world? Sign me up! But if I can't say "no," then I'm getting robbed. You are offered the choice, and the other option is to go elsewhere because even if you say no to the benefits at face value, by residing within the borders of the country you still benefit from that location in that the military prevents incursions into your property by default. Should we tax Japanese citizens then? I mean, our military protects them big-time. Surely the security provided means we can levy taxes to pay for it? The problem with your argument is that you approach the government as cooperative, rather than dominating. Taxation is theft because it *isn't* cooperative. The state doesn't tax people so that they can all contribute to their security and everyone will be happy; the state taxes people because the state has guns, and if they want my stuff, they can easily take it. Taxation is not about citizens pooling together resources to provide for common defense, it's about paying tribute to the Men With Guns so that they won't shoot you. 2017-03-30 08:28:35 reddit post Yes you do have the option of saying no - it's called going to another country As I pointed out before, if the mob comes around for a shakedown, you can move to another neighborhood. That doesn't make it not theft. Want all the stuff taxes buys you? Including the security of living in a first world country protected by its military? Then pay the damn tax. I agree! That's why I said I don't mind being robbed. But just because I don't mind it doesn't mean it isn't theft. If I refused to pay my taxes, if I say "this is my property and I won't let you take it," I get a fine. If I don't pay the fine, I get a court order. If I don't show up, an officer of the law will knock on my door to take me to court. And if I refuse to go, they will take me by force. I like the security and prosperity of living in a first-world country. I know that that wouldn't be possible without taxes. If you offered me the opportunity to live tax-free, but unable to use any government services, I'd say "no" in a heartbeat. But I was never offered the choice. *That* is what it means to say taxation is theft. Regardless of how noble the causes, or how great the benefits, I *can't* say no. 2017-03-30 06:29:20 reddit post Well I'm not a big fan of tariffs, free trade and all that jazz. And I do agree that taxes and spending absolutely need drastic cuts. 2017-03-30 06:27:48 reddit post I mean, if the local mobsters tried to shake you down, you could also leave the neighborhood. Just because you can avoid being robbed doesn't mean it's not theft. 2017-03-30 06:27:36 reddit post I'm not really understanding what you're saying here... 2017-03-29 19:25:01 reddit post Taxation is theft, because you don't have the option to say "no." For the most part I'm perfectly happy to be robbed; they only take some of my money, and they spend it on things that I need, like roads and national defense. That doesn't change the fact that it's theft. When I say "taxation is theft," it isn't a complaint about taxes existing, it's a reminder to those who want to tax and spend excessively. 2017-03-23 16:53:48 reddit post According to the sidebar, r/law is for "...discussing developments in the law, jurisprudence, and advice for those currently in law school or legal careers." How does this qualify? It's an ongoing investigation by a private company into one of their former employees. Is it news? Yes. Is it an ethical dilemma? Yes. But it has NOTHING to do with the law. This is just an attempt to hijack our sub and turn it into another political circlejerk. 2017-03-23 15:50:04 reddit post This has nothing to do with law. It's just a politics post.

McMguireWoods donated $38,000 to Tim Kaine (D) and $77,000 to George Allen (R). Why would a company donate to both candidates? Does the fact that they're a law firm matter? 2017-03-15 20:21:45 reddit post I play this deck! I call Ixidor "Seto Kaiba" and call it the "you've activated my trap card" deck. 2017-03-15 13:58:29 reddit post this is one example I've seen: Say carrying a fetus to term would (or at least might) kill the mother. This is a commonly cited example, and while I agree with your logic here, the scenario just doesn't happen. By the time a fetus is big enough to cause complications, it can be delivered by c-section. The only exception is ectopic pregnancy, for which, yes, abortion is the only option. And although the argument itself is sound, it obfuscates the issue. How big is a "serious" risk to the mother's life? Healthy childbirth has risks, do those count? And what about the mother's health? If it won't kill her, but will cause her serious harm, should she have to carry the child to term? How serious is that harm? Does harm to mental health count? Whenever a provision about "health" or "risk" is written into the law, pro-choice groups always push for the most broad definition of the terms. If a law was passed that said "abortion is illegal, except in cases where carrying the child to term would result in serious risk to the mother's health" then very little would be different. 2017-03-14 17:05:41 reddit post This avoids the whole crux of the abortion argument: is abortion the murder of an innocent? If the answer is "yes," then one must not only be opposed to abortion but also to its *legality*. After all, if there's one thing we can all agree that the government should do, it's prevent murder. If the answer is "no," then one must not only be pro-choice but also *pro-abortion*. Because on what grounds could we object to the practice? If the fetus is not a person, then abortion is just another relatively safe medical practice. Those who claim to be "morally opposed" to abortion but support its legality don't have a coherent argument. If it's not murder, what's the moral problem? If it is, how can it be legal? 2017-03-11 06:43:31 reddit post Neat!

The pro-life movement opposes abortion on the grounds that **killing a fetus is murder**. You don't have to be a pacifist, or anti-death penalty, to believe that murder should be illegal. Pro-life until you are born isn't being pro-life, is simply believing that pregnancy should be the punishment for sex, and people shouldn't have sex unless it is for babies with their husbands. See, there you go again, attributing malice without cause. Pregnancy isn't punishment, and the pro-life movement doesn't believe it is. The number of people who think that fun promiscuous sex is awesome and think abortion are murder is damn close to zero. These are two separate things. Plenty of religious people don't approve of premarital sex, but very few of them want to make it illegal. Just cause someone doesn't like your lifestyle doesn't mean they want to forbid it. They should be called "pro ruining people in punishment for enjoying sex outside of marriage". See, statements like this are what make the abortion debate so contentious. It isn't enough to say "you are wrong," oh no, you have to call them *evil*. Evil people! Who want to punish you for having fun! The big, scary, tyrannical bad guys who hate you and everything you hold dear. Nobody hates you. Nobody wants to punish you. You're not a victim, even if someone \*gasp* *disagrees* with you. 2017-03-03 19:31:01 reddit post The reason conservatives despise Planned Parenthood is because they perform abortions. Why is this so hard to understand? Why is it always "conservatives hate equality!" and "conservatives hate women!!!" and "conservatives hate the poor!!!1!"? The pro life movement has been VERY CLEAR about their reasons, their goals, and their motivations. Personhood begins at conception. Therefore, abortion is the killing of an innocent person. Therefore, abortion should not be considered lawful. 2017-03-01 03:42:21 reddit post To be honest, I don't have enough expertise in healthcare/business. I did find [this](http://dailysignal.com/2017/01/23/a-look-at-four-of-the-gops-obamacare-replacement-plans/) article that outlines a few of them, but in hindsight I really shouldn't be trying to speak with any credibility on this issue. 2017-03-01 00:43:22 reddit post There are several workable plans to replace Obamacare. That's the problem: there's no consensus on *which* plan should be implemented. Paul Ryan's Better Way? Burr/Hatch/Upton's CARE? Price's EPFA? The AHCRA? Republicans could agree that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced; they couldn't agree on what to replace it with. There definitely should have been a stronger push for a consensus alternative before the new Congress. 2017-02-28 18:49:29 reddit post I lIterally slept 13 hours last night.

"Serious risk to health" =/= "Serious risk to life".

Cade and Trump have a lot of parallels. 2017-01-20 19:25:33 reddit post I see what you're saying. My goal was just to outline that, despite the similarities between some Trump quotes and some Richard quotes, that I think they are two VERY different characters. That said, I recognize that your article was just some funny coincidences and not meant to be taken literally. No disrespect intended, I just get REALLY heated about my problematic fav. 2017-01-20 14:49:58 reddit post Ok I'm a HUGE Richard III fan and I have a lot of problems with this comparison. First of all, Trump isn't disabled. Richard's scoliosis is an integral part of his character, as the source of his insecurity and frustration. Second, Trump has only *said* controversial *words*. He's made promises, threats, and commitments that are impossible to follow through with. He's disparaged every interest group under the sun. But he hasn't *done* anything. Richard III was widely hated not for his words, but for his actions. He's killed a king, a prince, a lord, a father figure... and that's just before his play begins. We see in Act I Scene III that Richard actually has something of a silver tongue, always diplomatic, always at least pretending to play nice. Trump is the polar opposite of Richard in this regard. His words spark controversy, but the actions of his past are unremarkable. Third, much as I hate to say it, Trump was elected legitimately. He won the election fair and square, without any reasonable allegations of cheating. Richard III seized power illegitimately. Not only did he kill his brother (arguably both his brothers), he also undermined the monarchy by being essentially *elected* king. Act III Scene VII has Richard acting humble and pious, rejecting the crown, and telegraphing to the lords of Parliament that he is a) reluctant to become king, and b) easy to manipulate. He *actively cultivates* the image of a weak leader so that ambitious lower lords will be tempted to use him. Which brings me to point 4: Trump is a *far* prouder man than Richard III. King Richard is fully willing to look weak to further his goals. Good examples of this are Act I Scene II, Act II Scene I, and of course Act III Scene VII. Trump simply doesn't do this; his popularity depends upon his image as a strong, manly-man deal-maker. When challenged, Trump does not use rhetorical maneuvers to change the subject or reframe the question, he doubles down. When comparing Donald Trump and Richard III, there are few similarities. Frankly the only one I can think of is the tactic of publicly disagreeing with a person/group to befriend their political enemies (Act I Scene III). Even then, they go about it very different ways; Richard plays the victim, portraying his rivals as bullies, whereas Trump directly challenges and insults his opponents. 2017-01-14 14:53:40 reddit post d-deus vult? 2017-01-07 01:29:40 reddit post The actual "relationship" part.

The one girlfriend I had got annoyed that I didn't text/call her at all and I just... don't do that. For example, just a few days ago this girl I've known for half a year came to a party at my house, and we hit it off. Spent a half hour cuddling and chatting on the porch.

I took that to mean, "A penis that feels good in my body is the right size." Too big for me, too small for me...either one isn't as great as someone who fits you perfectly. I'd prefer to err on the smaller size because it doesn't fucking hurt, and certain positions and other things (like toys, or whatever) can make it amazing. Sex is really important in a relationship, and to deny that is to be seriously deluded. You're coming across as really self-conscious. Maybe you should man-(or woman-)up and apologize for being a raging dickhead to her.

How do people just shovel shit into their face with no regard to nutrition or calories at all? I think the main reason I'm back into my ED so hard is because seeing someone I know gain and gain and gain and let themselves go really messes with my head. That, and I work with the public. I see so many crusty middle aged/old people and obese people ride motorized scooters. Yuck. Yeah I'm vain whatever. At least I'm taking care of me and demonstrating personal discipline. I don't need to binge until I hurt a few times a day, as much as I'd sometimes like to, unlike someone I know. Basically: I'm frustrated that someone in my life doesn't keep up with themself when I try so hard. Anyone ever feel like this? ._. Help me I feel terrible about this. And no this isn't something I can approach them about. Talking it out is not a conversation I want to have.
subject3094 2015-08-08 16:45:52 reddit post Paraoptometric tech here. A contact prescription and a glasses prescription are different, and most states legally require a separate exam for them. They are also considered a medical device because they are inserted in your eye, so there are added fees that go along with them. Most states require a contact lense training session, and then a follow up appointment to check the fit, comfort, and health. This is legally required before they will release the RX, and then you can take the RX to 1-800 Contacts. Typically offices will charge one up front fee that covers all of this, including any troubleshooting and changing of lense brands until you are comfortable, and it will vary depending on whether or not you have an astigmatism high enough to require corrective contacts. Where I work it's $95 up front for spherical or $115 for toric (for astigmatism) for the fitting, not including contacts. The toric lenses are also more expensive. Typically they want that fitting fee paid half at the training session and half at the follow up, but they have allowed the fees to be paid out monthly. Contacts must be paid for at the time of receipt. I hope this gives you some info! Edit: also know that these fitting fees are a one time fee, every year after that it's just a $45 evaluation fee and then you get your RX. Also ask about rebates! We're doing a $40 rebate right now for certain brands. 2015-07-26 19:12:23 reddit post Kim is famous because she had a very private tape released to the public without her permission, and instead of letting it ruin her, she took advantage of the situation and used it to give her entire family jobs and careers.

I'm finding it easier to get myself to the gym than it has been in the past. I do have some serious gym frustration right now though, because my gym only has ONE free barbell, in a squat rack, to be used for ANY barbell exercises. That means if I need to bench, squat, deadlift, row, etc., I'm waiting for this ONE squat rack. Usually I haven't had too much trouble or had to wait too long until last week. A guy started showing up about five minutes before I do, and he is... he's just the worst. He is the slowest moving creature that has ever drawn breath, I'm sure of it. He does front squats. ONE REP, and rests for THREE MINUTES. He does this for an HOUR. I really try to be patient and not judge other's routines, but COME ON. I tried to get there earlier, and there he was. I came later, and there he was.

It was not easy, though, it could have been much harder. I am glad I picked it over HL bio (as I initially was faced with the same dilemma as you). You have to enjoy whatever subject you choose - espcecially your HLs. It makes them so much easier to learn and study will not be hated (as much). I love History and find writing essays to be something I have a good grasp of. For History, definitely know how to manage your time and thoughts in an exam. For paper 2 and 3, you will have to be strict with your time No more than 5 mins planning per essay, 45 min writing per essay. Studying is also a priority. There is a fuck ton of content in History, no matter what options your teacher picks. Good luck! 2016-05-22 08:32:57 reddit post In section 1 you want to basically outline your investigation. So, 1) WHAT the aim of the investigation is, 2) HOW you intend to approach the analysis of sources in your investigation, 3) a short statement of WHY you are investigating the chosen topic, 4) and a short statement or two on the nature of your sources and your method. This section should be sub-200 words. It is meant to be simple and straightforward. Say it as it is, don't exhibit verbosity. 2016-05-22 08:21:42 reddit post Check out any history magazines that you can access. The HistoryToday online archives have some pretty interesting articles on an array of History topics.

The watermelon one is my fave PSA for when you want an iced (sugary) drink 2016-05-17 02:44:09 reddit post It's almost summertime and that means slurpees galore... Well it turns out that slurpees and other Icey drinks are pretty horrible for you. So I have a recipe for those of you who still want your iced drinks, but want a low calorie and low sugar option. Simply grab frozen fruit of your choice. Throw it in the blender with two squirts of no calorie drink mix (I like lemonade), some stevia, and however much water you want. Blend it and serve. It's low calorie, low sugar, and will satiate your slurpee craving for under 100 calories for two cups.

It said 130lbs. Last summer I was 119. I don't know how to feel about this number. I knew I'd gain weight in my recovery but I feel so fat. I'm hoping that it says 130 because I ate a shit ton of fruit and drank a lot of water today. I'll weigh myself tomorrow morning so here's hoping that it's somewhere in the 120s. [Skin concerns] Are there any supplements/pills that help reduce oil on the face? 2016-04-04 18:26:40 reddit post I have super oily skin and if I don't spray a setting spray on my face after putting on makeup, it's like an oil spill. When I was on accutane it was great because my face didn't get oily at all. Now, a year later it's super oily again. Are there any supplements or pills I can take that will help reduce oil production? I just need to vent 2016-04-01 02:44:43 reddit post No flair bc I'm on mobile Basically I've always had a horrible relationship with food. I had an eating disorder when I was twelve and recovered through that. I grew up listening to my mom reminisce about when she was a size zero and listen to her say mean things about those who were overweight. I became so scared she would look at me and judge me, that I starved myself. My highest weight was 143 lbs when I was 17. I ate horribly, didn't exercise and was stressed out. I started running every day and I'm about five months I was at 130. When I began work I decided that I would only eat breakfast and a snack. In two months I was down to 119. I can't express to you how it felt to see that number. But it wasn't good enough (it never is, is it?) I wanted to be skinnier. I wanted to be 100 lbs. And when my mom dragged me to the doctors a month later and I stepped on the scale to see 126 lbs, I cried for the rest of the night. I realized I had a serious problem. But now it has gotten worse. I hate my body. I hate it with a passion. My arms are rolls of fat, my legs are horribly huge. My face is disgustingly fat and I hate having my photo taken. I can't eat a normal meal without throwing it up. I eat my breakfast and some fruit. Anything other than that I have to throw it up. I'm so afraid of gaining weight. I just want to be skinny. It felt so good to hear "you're so skinny" even though I didn't believe it at the time. I miss it. 2016-03-30 19:59:04 reddit post When I was younger and driving with my well-off friend, her mom accidentally pulled into a Hyundai dealership lot.

Any recommendations for a lightweight, full coverage foundation or Bb cream? 2016-03-30 05:22:41 reddit post I have really oily skin, uneven texture due to acne scars and hyperpigmentation. I currently wear Clarins 12 hr foundation and I find it has ok coverage but feels heavy and sinks into my pores. I've tried revlon colorstay, ReMarcable foundation, KVD lock-it, Tarte BB cream. None of them have lived up to their hype. I just need a full coverage foundation that isn't heavy and won't melt off! 2016-03-30 05:17:19 reddit post Clarin's 12hr foundation smells like cucumbers:) 2016-03-28 04:40:29 reddit post www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/homemade-bagels-recipe.html 2016-03-27 12:32:48 reddit post Really?

How lazy of me 2016-03-27 12:06:24 reddit post Basically bought two small portions of salmon. Took a mixture of salt and brown sugar and coated them really well and wrapped them in plastic wrap then placed them on an upside down bowl inside of a container. I then put a plate on them and smooshed them down and plastic wrapped that. Left it in the fridge for about 5 days and flipped the fished every day. All of the juices collected at the bottom so I knew it was working. When you want to serve it just rinse the fish until all the salt mix comes off. Then slice it and enjoy! It's pretty damn good and all you need is some patience as it is a low matenience recipe!

Major as in, completely unable to even order at fast food places, had to wear sunglasses everywhere because otherwise I was convinced everyone was staring at me. This went on for a couple years until I had a sudden realization. Nobody gives a fuck about you. Your friends and family, sure, of course. But the dozens/hundreds of people you see every day? They see dozens/hundreds more. You are nothing but a blip on the screen of life for them. Nobody gives a singular fuck. The chick at the counter at Tims isn't going home and judging you in her spare time, she has to serve literally thousands of people in a month. You are nothing to her. She won't even remember your face ten minutes from now. Bam. Just like that, my social anxiety was gone. Still have a wack of other problems but hey. 2015-07-26 04:14:51 reddit post I thought so too! Little me had it all figured out; the movie companies would find suicidal people and give them plastic surgery to look like the actors that are dying in the movie.

In Japanese, there are R sounds instead. Katakana is used mostly for English words, and if they have an L in them, the closest sound in Japanese is R. For example, Lemon. Hiragana has only ra, ri, ru, re, and ro sounds. Re sounds closest to Le, therefore it's used in place of the L sound. 2015-06-30 12:03:22 reddit post Me me me me meeee! I love smoking.

I think catching yourself when you're thinking about eating also helps. Eat small amounts and then stay away from the food. Being around it will only tempt you. Do something to distract yourself and avoid people who are eating. Sometimes that's difficult though.

But it will most likely be a life long problem for me. I really hate mental illness I think I'm relapsing 2016-10-13 20:33:53 reddit post Hello, I think I'm relapsing back into my anorexia after going into treatment in February. I've started missing meals and snacks this week and the meals I do eat are much smaller than they should be. I thought that I would be happier being healthy, but I'm not, I'm still miserable and depressed. I just can't decide if I should keep trying to eat healthy and push down the urges or if I should just let myself slip back into my anorexia. I hate this, I just want to die and leave a pretty, skinny corpse. Ignore my stats, those were before going into treatment. I have no idea what I weigh now, but I'm above 130lbs I don't know if I can recover... 2016-04-06 04:10:52 reddit post 8 weeks ago I went into inpatient treatment and I started group therapy 5 weeks ago. But I don't know if I can recover. I'm eating everything I should be, everyone says that I'm doing great. But I feel horrible, my depression is really bad, I'm selfharming and I've gotten so big. I'm the biggest I've ever been in my life. My suicidal thoughts are through the roof, and starving myself is the only way I'm brave enough to kill myself. I was so close to being perfect and dead. I don't know if I can do this anymore, but everyone would be so disappointed with me if I stopped. I just don't know what to do anymore. 2016-03-16 22:56:20 reddit post Put a heating pad on your stomach, it helps with the bloating and pain 2016-03-16 02:33:53 reddit post I'm in a treatment program right now, but I'm debating if I should stay.

But it's for people who aren't ready to recover and need a place to vent or talk about the struggles of this illness with people who won't force them to recover and who will understand 2016-03-06 20:26:07 reddit post It's a super accepting community! Everyone is welcome there 2016-03-06 19:58:15 reddit post /r/proed has one inpatient update: one week 2016-02-25 01:03:25 reddit post I've been in inpatient for a week now. I thought I'd post an update because I'm super bored and having a really rough day. I've been feeling really depressed since I've been here, but especially today. My selfharm and suicidal thoughts are through the roof and the ed voice won't fucking shut up. Most meals have been ok, typical hospital food. But I had a breakdown over a sandwich the other day. I just started bawling my eyes out because I hate sandwiches, especially egg salad. Today was med review, I got 2 15 minute passes a day to go smoke which is awesome. But they also said that my bmi is almost 16, that puts me at around 100lbs. I feel so fucking fat. All I hear in my head is how fat, disgusting and a failure I am. I've gained faster than they thought I would, so I'll probably start group therapy on Monday. I just want to lose this weight. I feel disgusting and horrible and fat. I hate myself, but I know I should try recovery, but I just want to go home and starve myself. I'm on a general psychiatric unit. Most people here are nice. There's this one guy who is such an asshole, everyone hates him! Sorry, this turned into a really long post, I just feel so lonely Edit: And my roommate is so thin. She is so triggering. 2016-02-18 14:48:42 reddit post I just had my first night in ip. It's really strange here, but everyone seems really nice. I'm definitely the fattest one here though, which is really upsetting. Plus I can't go for cigarettes for a while and that is really stressing me out. My first meal is in a few minutes and I'm really scared Thank you and goodbye 2016-02-18 00:00:04 reddit post I finally got the call to go into inpatient treatment. I have to be at the hospital in an hour and a half. I'm anxious, scared but excited. This is a new chapter in my life, but I hope it all works out. I just wanted to thank all of you lovely people. You have all be so nice and supportive through this incredibly rough part of my life. I'm so glad that I found you guys, but it's my time to leave. I really hope that each and every one of you reach your UGWs and find your happiness. You all deserve it. You are all beautiful people, inside and out! Thank you and goodbye! Edit: oh god, I'm the fattest one here :( 2016-02-17 21:00:28 reddit post Purging is a really horrible habit to get into, it's super addictive and harmful. It usually leads to weight gain because you think you can have bigger binges, but you still end up only purging 50% of your cals and you absorb so much more because of your now bigger binges. But if you really want, you can pm me 2016-02-17 20:10:04 reddit post I have a friend who told a bunch of people at school, the school counselor and my mom when I was 14. But my mom denies that she was told, so I don't know if she actually told my mom. But she definitely told people at school Suggestion for a weekly thread 2016-02-17 19:04:31 reddit post I thought that a weekly (or monthly) thread for health/harm-reduction/beauty tips would be good. What we do really takes a toll on our bodies and if we had a thread where people could ask advice on harm reduction and beauty tips could be really helpful. That way we can help each other stay as healthy and beautiful as possible. I know I've had problems with some things but I didn't want to start a new thread for it 2016-02-17 17:14:44 reddit post I have 3 rabbits, a cat, an elephant and a sloth. Plus I bought them as gifts for so many people. They are so soft and such good quality 2016-02-17 16:33:49 reddit post I always make sure to plan my binges so the flavours will go together when I purge, so I usually end up with a sweet binge and a savoury binge 2016-02-17 16:31:39 reddit post Omg, that's a jellycat stuffed rabbit! I have so many of those stuffed animals. They sold them at my old job so I would always buy some when we got a new shipment 2016-02-17 16:21:48 reddit post FYI, you can still get pregnant if you don't have your period 2016-02-17 06:20:08 reddit post No, but I take sleeping pills every night 2016-02-17 04:45:48 reddit post I have "recovered" and relapsed so many times I can't even count anymore 2016-02-17 04:39:13 reddit post I definitely flushed about 40$ worth of food down the toilet in the last 24 hours. I can't afford to throw all my money away. Thanks, good luck to you too 2016-02-17 04:23:26 reddit post I saw that, I had no advice to give you. Binging and purging is an unhealthy, disgusting and wasteful habit, but so addictive. My plan to stop binging and purging 2016-02-17 03:55:07 reddit post I've been binging and purging way too much lately, I have gained lbs in 2 months and I feel absolutely disgusting. Seeing that number made me want to throw up. So I've made a plan to stop. I'm posting this here for accountability. I feel like I've made so many of these posts though, but here we go again. I b/p'ed multiple times today. I had a big dinner which I didn't purge, I feel pretty guilty about that, but I need to stop purging. I will eat around 800 calories for the next few days. Then on saturday I'm having lunch with my mom for her birthday, I will order a BLT. Then starting on sunday I will restrict to 600 calories for a few days. After that I will return to my usual 400 calories a day. I also plan to read a chapter of my book or work on my jigsaw puzzle every time I have an urge to binge. I really hope this works because I don't think I can handle to go down this road again. B/p really takes a toll on my mental and physical health. 2016-02-16 19:00:22 reddit post Oh god no, my life is hell. I've been doing the same thing everyday for almost 2 months now. I miss my old life. I'm reading the Harry Potter books, but I'm not getting much reading done because my concentration is shit 2016-02-16 17:38:36 reddit post I wake up at around 9 am. Go for a cigarette, then I have breakfast and check social media. I watch some tv, have more cigarettes. I have lunch and watch more tv. Then in the afternoon I either watch tv, knit, work on a jigsaw puzzle or read. Have more cigarettes and some diet coke. Then my mom comes home from work and we have dinner. After we walk our dog. We watch some tv or a movie together. Then it's bed time, I get ready for bed at around 10:30. Some days I have doctors appointments. My life is incredibly boring 2016-02-16 03:03:01 reddit post Companies can say something is 0 cals if it has less than 5 calories per serving 2016-02-16 02:37:24 reddit post I don't have any experience with this, but I have a few trans friends. When you go on HRT it's like going through puberty again, and that takes a lot of energy! So it would make sense that it would make you hungrier. I hope you all the best in your transition! Congrats 2016-02-16 01:55:20 reddit post I know how you feel, I spend my days moping around the house, which leads to binging and purging. I have no motivation to do anything but watch tv and b/p. It really sucks 2016-02-15 19:25:00 reddit post If you are weighing yourself multiple times a day, then it will fluctuate because of food or water weight. It's best to only weigh yourself once a day, at the same time 2016-02-15 02:43:20 reddit post I absolutely love fldebolle, but it's not available where I live. I would probably get so fat if I had access to them everyday. 2016-02-15 02:38:28 reddit post Breakfast: Chocolate chia pudding (143) Lunch: Egg whites (60), celery (6), red bell pepper (11) and cucumber (8) Dinner: Shirataki noodles with vegetable bouillon and soya sauce (26) Snacks: Vanilla greek yogurt (140), sugar free lemon jello (20), diet coke (0) and mia sport (0) Total: 414 calories I left my house for other than cigarettes, food or doctors appointment for the first time in months. I was out of the house 5 and half hours. I am completely drained, I have absolutely no energy left. I really want to eat a jar of peanut butter right now. But I don't have any. 2016-02-15 02:15:23 reddit post I could definitely go for a jar of peanut butter right now, thank god I don't have any or else it would turn into a crazy binge 2016-02-15 01:56:45 reddit post Plus you don't even lose weight, most of the time you gain 2016-02-14 17:34:06 reddit post I like to stay under 500 calories 2016-02-14 16:16:25 reddit post Definitely binging and purging. It fucks your teeth, electrolytes and organs wayyyyy more than restricting 2016-02-14 06:08:40 reddit post I haven't binged and purged in 2 days. I'm hoping that I'm back in the restricting groove 2016-02-14 04:21:22 reddit post This is my biggest fear! I'm also terrified that they will give me regular coke instead of diet 2016-02-14 02:30:36 reddit post Breakfast: Oatmeal with brown sugar and cocoa (147) Lunch: Egg whites (60), celery (6), red bell pepper (11) and cucumber (8) Dinner: Shirataki noodles with vegetable bouillon and soya sauce (26) Snacks: Sugar free lemon jello (20), chia pudding (142), diet coke (0), diet 7up (0) and mio spor (0) Total: 421 calories 2016-02-13 23:26:55 reddit post I like to drink diet soda or vitamin water zero. It's also good to have a bunch of low cal snacks ready, that way you can eat a bunch but not go over your calorie goals. You can save your meals for after you've smoked. For me I just avoid eating anything or else the floodgates open and I eat everything, but if I don't eat then I'm fine. Plus eating shortens the high 2016-02-13 19:49:04 reddit post That is amazing! You definitely deserve to be happy and to celebrate 2016-02-13 03:13:11 reddit post Breakfast: Oatmeal with brown sugar and cocoa (147) Lunch: Shirataki noodles with vegetable bouillon and soya sauce (26) Dinner: Shirataki noodles with vegetable broth and soya sauce (26) Snacks: Sugar free lemon jello (20), vanilla greek yogurt (140), diet coke (0), diet 7up (0) and mio sport (0) Total: 359 calories I have a bad cold right now, so I'm having lots of soup and diet 7up. I'm hoping this will help me get back into the restriction groove. I still have a bit of leftover birthday cake, I've been pretty good at resisting the urges to b/p it, hopefully I will keep staying strong. My mom also said that she will stop buying peanut butter because she knows I will b/p a whole jar in a day. I need to get back into my groove 2016-02-12 17:59:57 reddit post I think it can raise your BMR at least 200 calories, probably more 2016-02-11 20:45:11 reddit post I love sweet potatoes, but without a food scale I can't know the calorie count, so I just avoid them. I wish I could have some 2016-02-11 19:54:18 reddit post Your metabolism speeds up when you are on your period 2016-02-11 18:30:37 reddit post If it's non-perishable you could bring it to your local food bank 2016-02-11 18:28:38 reddit post Not when I'm restricting. But I've been wasting so much money on food so I can binge and purge. Spent over 30$ on food yesterday and it all ended up in the toilet 2016-02-11 18:14:44 reddit post The closer I get to going into treatment, the more I freak out about weight gain. They want me to have a bmi of at least 20, but I have never been in the healthy bmi range in my life. It terrifies me that I will have to get in that range. Plus it will make me the fatest in my family. I also have no motivation to do anything anymore. I have books, Lego sets, knitting, but all I want to do is watch shitty tv. I don't even have the motivation to start a tv series on Netflix or watch a movie. It just takes so much 2016-02-11 17:58:23 reddit post Sometimes a higher intake helps a plateau. It might boost your metabolism and kickstart your weight loss. I wish I had advice to give you, but I'm in a very similar boat right now 2016-02-11 17:54:03 reddit post I don't understand why they lock those dumpsters. It's not like they are using that food anyways. Sometimes clothing stores throw away old clothing and they will cut it up so people can't wear.

subject6681 Fasting for a month: Update 2016-11-08 07:58:21 reddit post Well.. I failed. But not because of lack of willpower, or anything. I was in my dorm room, when I felt a little hungry. This was about day 5 of my fast. Naturally, I used water to suppress my hunger. Although I used a little bit *too* much water. I felt extremely light headed and dizzy. I collapsed. When I woke up I was completely covered in my own shit and vomit. My headache was surreal and my eyes were bulging. So I went to ER. Electrolyte imbalance. So....I'm dropping out of Uni. My parents want me to come home and "work on my health". Not sure if thats going to look like inpatient or outpatient. Fuck this. There is nothing to do in my home town. I won't be able to get back in until Fall 2017. That's almost a whole year now.. I'm 18. No job. Not a student. And moving back in with my parents. Kill me. 2016-11-06 08:11:51 reddit post I wish I could help you man, I am currently in a University dorm and things are not going well for me eating disorder wise. I struggle every single day.

Not sure how often I'll do these posts either.. I'll try *not* to every day because that would spam the subreddit.

I spend every waking moment of my life feeling depressed like my life is spiraling out of control and I HATE it. Years have passed any nothing changes.

Usually, I don't have any issues with my sleep. However, when you throw my eating disorder into the mix I find that my sleep issues go through the roof. When I am restricting I sleep wayyy too much because I am constantly tired. When I am fasting (especially for long periods of time) I can't sleep AT ALL. Like right now I am about 8.5 days into my fast and It's currently 1am and I am not tired. A couple days ago I went 36 hours without sleep. This is a problem as it's interfering with my university work. thoughts? 2016-10-18 22:10:44 reddit post **Day 8 of my Fast!!** Currently feel horrible, but lets see how far I can push this.

subject8657 Request: Realizing in retrospect I may be anorexic/EDNOS. How to deal 2017-05-15 11:36:17 reddit post TL;DR: I was naturally extremely thin/underweight my whole life until recently. Now that Im a healthier size Im starting to obsess over being thin. Looking back I see signs of possible anorexia or EDNOS. Not sure what to think or how to deal. Any advice or comments appreciated. Thank you. Im almost 30 and most of my life Ive been very thin and petite and not much of an eater. Being skinny was pretty much my defining feature and I was accused of having an eating disorder countless times, including by numerous mental health professionals based on my appearance. Its always been a love hate relationship with my body. I loved having a flat tummy and skinny legs, but I also hated having small boobs and ass. I never tried to be thin. Its just how I was and I felt really fortunate. Being thin is so idealized in our culture, especially where I live. I got a lot of praise and attention from men for being so thin and a lot of jealousy and admiration from women. I always had a perverse pride in being able to go days without eating, like that was some kind of talent. Obviously, I was barely eating. Even though Id go days without eating and subsisting off protein shakes or tea, there were benign explanations for my eating habits and weight; I have lightning speed metabolism. I'm a picky eater. I hate eating, even when Im hungry. I was too lazy to eat or make food. I was too stressed to eat. I didnt have time. During grad school I went months living off a single protein shake and half a granola bar per day. And lastly, not eating was a symptom of my other serious mental health issues (bipolar disorder/manic depression, PTSD, ADHD, and alcoholism/addiction). But being accused of having an eating disorder used to send me into a fierce rage like nothing else. I absolutely hated anyone who suggested - even with the best of intentions - that I had an eating disorder. I was vicious to anyone who commented on my size or committed the ultimate sin of joking about childrens clothes. Ive been through a lot of mental health treatment, but only for addiction and BP, never talked much about food. However, I had a therapist tell me I dont have an ED, but I have disordered eating. Is that a thing? It made sense because my bad eating habits correlated a lot to my mood swings. When Im at either extreme I dont eat. Maybe she said that because I was so insistent I didnt have an ED and thought Id fire her, but regardless, she helped me work on my eating habits a bit. Ive known a lot of girls with severe EDs and I never really related to them on that issue. I always thought BP and drugs were my real problem. Anyways - about three years ago I became extremely depressed in large part due to my tiny size. Almost every day after work/school Id look in the mirror and cry at my emaciated, child-like body. One time I stood in a Nordstrom fitting room and bawling hysterically because even size 00 pants were too big and baggy. I vividly remember the time a guy I liked told me I looked unhealthy and unattractive (out of concern). There were points of despair when I was so overwhelmed because I didn't even know where to begin with getting healthier. So in typical me fashion I did nothing and used it as fodder for self-loathing. Finally, about 8 months ago I decided to start working out to gain the right kind of weight and feel healthier. Great idea! Working out regularly got me eating better (at least two meals twice a day) and I gained a fair amount of muscle. Basically went from being extremely thin to curvy (Hooray! Tits and ass!).but now Im kind of freaking out and feeling fat and disgusting. I know that thats not true though and that (as usual) my mind is playing tricks on me with really harmful toxic self talk. Realizing how sick these thoughts are has made me reexamine my past behaviors and relationship with my body. Im starting to think I may have actually been anorexic. In hindsight my passive obsession with being thin seems much more malignant. Why would I get so insanely defensive and enraged at being accused of having an ED or any kind of comments about my size? Why did I continue having "disordered eating" even after getting treatment for BP and addiction if it's a just a symptom of those? Why the fuck was I proud of being able to not eat? Why did I see eating as a weakness or fault? But at the same time - how could I be anorexic if I got depressed over being too thin? The reason this is an issue is that now that Im a healthy weight the thin obsession is creeping back and I keep telling myself I just need to stop eating entirely like before and that my body is a disgusting lumpy fat blob. Back when I was underweight and depressed Id look at thinspo to cheer myself up. Now I look at it and I miss being that thin. I feel so fat and gross. Objectively I guess thats not true and literally everyone I know tells me I look so much better. But I cant help missing being thin and comparing myself to skinny girls. I hate my tummy and that my thighs touch the whole way down and that I now have cellulite. Im so frustrated by these feelings and I dont fucking understand where theyre coming from. Do I seriously need to have every fucking category of mental illness there is? Is there any size Ill be happy with? (note: No, of course not. I dont deserve that.) Thank you if youve read this far. Thats commendable. I guess my questions are can anyone relate? Ever gone through something similar? Is it possible I was anorexic or does this sound more a symptom of BP or Im blowing it all out of proportion? Was I in denial? Is it even possible to be so in denial? What do I do from here? Request: My girlfriend might have an ED. How can I help her and also avoid relapsing? 2017-05-14 22:53:53 reddit post My gf and I are both in college (and both women). In middle school/high school, I had a mild ED but I've been recovered for years now. She has confessed that she worries about her weight, and struggled with body image stuff when she was younger. Recently, she lost weight and makes a lot of excuses to avoid eating. Basically showing all the behaviors I recognize. She seems so unhappy and I feel like I'm losing her, and it makes me so anxious and the only thing that makes me feel better is reverting to those behaviors. If we're eating together, and she doesn't finish her meal, then neither can I, stuff like that. I know that is probably making it worse. What can I do? Request: Having trouble not being sick after eating a meal 2017-05-14 02:17:01 reddit post I used to purge about 4-5 times a week for a year, and stopped suddenly due to problems it was causing. Ever since then I've had problems eating a meal without feeling the physical need to be sick. It's like I can't swallow food properly anymore since it feels like I haven't managed to swallow it properly, and I feels like food gets stuck in my throat. I can be sick without forcing my fingers down my throat, I can just bring it back up without even trying. It's pretty gross, but I don't think I've eaten a full meal in the last couple of years without experiencing this and I don't know if this is normal for people who have purged somewhat frequently in the past. Does anyone have any experience or advice? Request: Performer with eating disorder 2017-05-10 11:16:08 reddit post Last Friday, I saw a professional modern dance performance with my wife. Although we both enjoyed the show, we were both somewhat disturbed by the appearance of one dancer. Although neither of us are health professionals capable of capable of making a diagnosis, this woman's physique suggested fairly a severe eating disorder. The rest of the dancers, men and women, were fit but not at all underweight, so she wasn't just the skinniest among many skinny in the ensemble. While I certainly don't want to judge anyone else's body, I'm also concerned if the money I pay to this dance group is supporting deeply unhealthy body image. I remember hearing that certain fashion shows have now agreed not to use models with eating disorders. Perhaps the same could be done among dance companies. What's the best response to this situation? Keep my opinion to myself? Write a letter to the dance group management stating my unease? Any thoughts are welcome. Please note that I know I'm coming from a place of real ignorance with this question, but if my question is offensive to anyone, I promise it's not my intention. Request: worried that i'm developing an ED (again maybe?) 2017-05-10 11:13:04 reddit post Hi, I've never posted here or even seen the page until I did some fearful googling this evening, but y'all seem like the right community to reach out to. I have major depression and I've recognized one period of extreme restrictive eating in my life (my first half of high school) that left me underweight before gaining it back. I'm in my junior year of college now, and I'm at the lower end of a healthy weight range, starting to worry that those tendencies to restrict could be a bigger deal than I'm equipped to handle. The appetite loss that comes with my depression starts a cycle of self-starving because I don't want to eat, enjoying the feeling of having lost weight, and perpetuating a lack of appetite. I think sometimes I restrict for self harm. I'm scared of the feeling of satisfaction I get at the end of a day with little to no food, and though I can recognize that my low mood is exacerbated by a lack of food, the feeling of getting thinner often trumps the desire to eat for my health. I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder but I'm starting to worry that I could be doing more harm that I intended. If you have any advice or literally anything I just feel a little lost. Request: Friend has relapsed 2017-05-10 11:11:46 reddit post A college friend of mine has been open about her mental health struggles for as long as I've known her. She has bipolar disorder and was hospitalised for anorexia nervosa in her mid teens and has been in recovery for as long as I've known her. As I've only known her in recovery I can't be certain of a relapse but, it seems likely. She's moving to another country soon also and I know change can trigger disordered eating. I've noticed recently she has lost a significant amount of weight and I'm concerned. From what I gather it's a big no-no to comment on someone with an eating disorders weight. How can I express concern in a constructive, helpful manner. Thanks! Request: How to eat that first real meal 2017-05-05 18:47:32 reddit post I am a 30 y/o mother of two and I've been struggling with an eating disorder for some time now. I really, really want to get better but I'm having a hard time eating a true meal. Every day I tell myself "today you'll eat XYZ" but then I panic because "if I eat XYZ I won't be able to have ABC later". So my question is how those of you who have recovered had that first REAL meal and what did you eat? Request: Out of options, seeking advice 2017-05-03 12:23:52 reddit post I'm a 27 year old male that is in the healthy range, after being underweight 2 years ago. I can only eat a very small amount of food before my stomach wants to flip, everything just tenses up and I can feel the food work its way back up. I have seen two gastroenterologist, done two endoscopies, had a gastric emptying testing, tried a variety of medications such as Tecta and some others that aren't coming to my head right now. Both have no idea what is wrong with, there doesn't seem to be anything physically wrong. In addition to this, I had developed a chronic cough that seemed to appear at the same time as the eating issue, seeing a Pulmonologist to see if we can deal with that problem as well. Coughing makes eating harder, symptoms worsen and wanting to vomit makes coughing happen. It is an endless cycle. I am confident that I am not overeating when I eat what I should be able to, now I can barely finish a normal amount before feeling extremely terrible. I am actually trying to gain weight, I've been underweight my whole life, and not fit at all, I have put time and effort into exercise and I am finding myself having to manage my eating nearly as a full time job just to maintain this weight. Others have hinted that it may be a psychological issue, although it happened at the same time as a pretty traumatic breakup of a long term relationship, it has been 5+ years since and I don't see how it is a problem. The other change that happened at that time was moving back to Home after graduating University, the environment could have an impact on my cough and in term affected my ability to eat. At least that's what I hope it is...it would be the simplest to solve, I vacuum and clean my room and house twice a week now, hoping to improve the air and improve my cough. Well...I'm actually not sure what I'm asking for, I'm just at wit's end on what to do. Even with no psychological trauma before, the stress I may get from having to manage my meals (small meals, multiple times a day, snacking here and there) just to maintain my weight may affect me in the long run if nothing is fixed. Does anyone have experience with this, or advice for me? Request: Weight restored, but still messed up 2017-05-03 12:18:40 reddit post I am recovering from a restrictive ED. I am almost fully weight restored since more than a month, but I still have disordered thoughts about food. In a way my thoughts have become more disordered lately, because when I was gaining weight I knew I HAD to gain weight, so I just ate whatever I wanted without any limitation. Now it's different. I tried to eat "normally" for a while, but I just ended up restricting again. Not to lose weight, but to maintain it. I avoid certain foods that I ate when I had to gain weight. I obsessively weigh everything and check the nutritional labels. I try to convince myself that junk food isn't really my thing and that I'm really into "healthy food", such as green veggies. I only eat at certain hours. I stop eating when the others stop too and not when I feel full. I exercise a bit (not compulsively) just to shed calories and not because I enjoy it. I tell lies to my dietitian, writing that I actually do feel full after a meal and that I didn't eat pasta because I truly didn't want it. I often weigh myself after a meal and feel happy if the numbers on the scale don't go up. I check my body. I am secretly happy when there is a low-calorie meal instead of a high-calorie meal that I actually like more. And so on. Yesterday I decided to challenge some of these thoughts. I ate things and quantities that were uncomfortable to me, just because my ED was telling me not to. Of course, 5 minutes after that I panicked and thought OH MY GOD WHAT DID I DO I HAVE A BINGE EATING DISORDER I'M TOTALLY BECOMING OBESE. I regularly see a therapist, but he just doesn't seem to help much - he was the one who, while I was in the gaining-weight phase, told me that I didn't need to "go too far" and "become bulimic" and that I had to "eat like a normal person". That's not what you want to hear if you're a recovering quasi-anorexic. How do I get out of the loop? Request: How to help my SO face the disorder all over again 2017-04-30 16:04:17 reddit post My SO has an eating disorder. When she was younger it was really bad, and at first i was clueless and she could keep it hidden, etc. It got so bad she was hospitalized, tried to kill herself, we broke up multiple times, etc. But eventually i caught on, learned a lot, and after years it all came out and though it was tough, we worked together mostly. After years of therapy and various treatments she was in recovery. I saw huge improvements in her life. We got very close, i loved the person she was and we got married. Fast forward a couple decades and we are still together, and ive noticed a steep decline in the last year or so (im not sure what started it). Being that i went through it with her the first time, i picked it up quickly. Unfortunately, she would rather turn the clock back 20 years. Even if i catch her in the act, she still acts like i dont know what im talking about, and know nothing. She still tries to hide it, and pretends like it isnt happening. She answers "im fine" anytime i ask how she is. Its as if the whole learning process never happened, and she is pretending im an ignorant stranger again, that i never sat through hundreds of therapy sessions where she outlined exactly what she thought and did, etc. It makes it so much more difficult this time, because we have already gone through all this before. and its that much more frustrating for me to be left out again, or treated as if im stupid, ignorant, and worthless. Im back to being the new boyfriend who if she is sneaky enough, will never know whats really going on. I know she would rather me play along and turn a blind eye, but i cannot do that, because i care so much for her. I cant confront her however because she just shuts down, or denies it, or calls me paranoid, etc. Its brought our marriage to the breaking point. How do i start the process all over again, without making it worse. Especially since this time she seems to have lost all will to fight it.

Stephanie Request: Bulimia and Stomach Ulcers 2017-04-30 16:01:33 reddit post My SO has been a long term suffer of Bulimia for 10 years. He purges almost everything he eats from snacks to meals. As a result he has number of health problems including Anemia, Zero Libido, frequent dizzy spells, acid reflux, little to no energy and some chest pains that tingle his arms. Hes been in DBT for about a year but little progress has been made and hes still struggling with his relationship with alcohol. Needless to say, myself and his family is deathly worried for his health and fertility. He's thrown up twice this week involuntarily which isnt normal (and hes not ill either). His mother is worried he might have stomach ulcers. I wondered if anyone has any experience with stomach ulcers that they are happy to share with me? Request: How do I tell my mom I want to eat a certain way? 2017-04-30 16:00:49 reddit post I'm going to live with my mum in a few weeks for the summer once I get out of school. She found out I was undereating earlier this year and is basic the only person who knows about it. I still get obsessive thoughts and feelings of guilt around food but I'm levels of magnitudes better than I was at the beginning of the year and am usually trying to make my weight go up. It's a lot easier for me to eat without feeling if guilty if I feel like the food I'm eating is healthy. I really worried when trying to explain this to her that she'll think its just my disorder talking. The last time I saw her she got visibly concerned anytime I denied myself some kind of desert and would then pressure me to eat it. I feel like this really only exacerbated the problem and causes tension between us.I know she's coming from a place of compassion and concern. I really don't want to diminish that. I've been thinking about maybe getting a doctor to vouch for my choices but If there was I could resolve this in conversation without having to go that far that would be preferred. Do you have any advice about how to go about having this conversation? Request: 20F, Help with Bad Teeth 2017-04-30 15:59:48 reddit post My teeth have been very off-white ever since my adult ones came in. I stopped smiling with my teeth when I was about eleven. Now, eating disorders have further damaged them. I honestly think never being able to feel comfortable smiling is the biggest cause of my depression and anxiety. My teeth make me feel disgusting. I just don't know what to do. I'm about four years away from finishing grad school, and will have six figure debt at that point before even thinking about a mortgage, etc., so I don't really know if veneers or something of the sort are an option for me. I'm just so lost and don't know what to do. I'm so tired of feeling ugly, and gross. My teeth definitely contribute to my body dysmorphia and eating disorder, but I feel like I can't fix them. I don't even know what my overall question is, I just feel like I need some help. I can't do this anymore. Request: Question about libido and periods after recovery 2017-04-27 14:56:31 reddit post I will start off by saying I am not sure whether this is the correct place to be posting about this. If not I would appreciate being pointed in the right direction. My long distance girlfriend battled with a pretty severe eating disorder for around 2 years, and began recovery just over a year ago. Since then most things have improved greatly. She is eating a healthy amount, gradually feeling better about her body and has a much more positive outlook on life in general. However, I am looking for advice on a couple of things she opened up to me about recently. First off, she has not had her period at all since the early stages of her ED. She knew that was something that commonly happened during the ED, but now she considers herself recovered from it, she is becoming increasingly more worried about her period still not returning. I have read that it can just take longer in some people, but that doesn't seem to comfort her much. Secondly, she opened up to me about how she hasn't felt any sexual drive in well over 2 years and that it is something she really wants to feel, but is becoming very frustrated that it has not returned either. We have done some research together and have written a list of foods that are said to increase estrogen in the hopes that it will have some effect. She said that she has also tried watching porn on occasion but it hasn't really done anything for her and just makes her more frustrated that she's not feeling anything. We are also going to be meeting up for 2 months in a few weeks (which is what started these conversations) and she said that she is interested in trying things with me at a slow pace. I am of course willing to help her in any way I can and want her to feel comfortable with these things. What I'm really asking is for any advice people may have on these subjects. As her partner, I want to know if there is anything else I can be doing to help her through this and reassure her, and also if there's anything I can be doing to help her regain her sex drive. Thanks for listening. Request: Night Eating Disorder 2017-04-27 11:05:11 reddit post Hi, I've had Night eating disorder for a number of years now. At least 6+. I usually wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom then i'll have an uncontrollable urge to get something to eat, i'll inevitably give in, in my groggy state. I've only been successful in not giving into this urge a few times, but it takes a lot of mental struggle and I have to prepare myself before bed. My question is for anyone who has suffered from this and overcome it. How did you do it? Couple things to note. I'm an X-alcoholic. This did, however, start while i was drinking. I've been sober for 4.5 years now though and it continues. I suffer from Depression and Anxiety and take anti-depressants for it. I have also been vegan for the past 2.5 years. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I could use the advice. Thanks. Request: Feeling at a complete loss 2017-04-27 11:03:56 reddit post Hi, I'm kind of feeling at a loss with everything right now and just don't really know where to turn to. I feel like going to my GP is pointless as I'm not underweight so I wont be able to get any kind of help. I've suffered from anorexia for a good 6 ish years in varying time periods over the last ten or so years. The point I'm at now is that to all intents and purposes on the outside I eat ok and I exercise, so therefore everything must be hunky dory and there's no problems at all going on. But instead I am absolutely miserable, and get so depressed at times that I just want to end everything. Everyday I panic if I don't do my normal exercise plan, if I can't go for a walk in the morning I have a complete melt down, if I can't go for a walk lunch time I'm distraught, and if I can't make this up with a workout DVD at home I feel devastated. And now, to top it off for me, because I may start cycling to work, my whole workout plan is going to change, meaning I'll cycle to and from work but not have the time for my evening workouts which means I am so so terrified of gaining weight as I may not be doing the same amount / enough exercise. After years of restricting what I eat and calorie counting I've gotten to a semi happy point where I try and eat really well throughout the day, and when I get home eat treats after my evening meal which I enjoy. I personally feel like I eat too much at these points but my partner tells me I don't. Either way, my weight has kind of been stable ish and whilst I still feel like I HAVE to do exercise, I'm kind of ok with my weight. But I just cannot cope with the upcoming change, where I feel my cycle to work just won't be enough exercise which leads to : I'm going to have to do loads of extra exercise every evening, cut back even more (and the minute I think of any kind of diet I start crying after years of this, and trying to get to a point where I'm trying to just eat what I want and enjoy life) and now I just feel nothing I do will ever be enough to stop a huge influx of weight gain - like an inevitable doom, and I really just can't cope. I'm just so so tired of trying to balance everything, that everything has to add up to prevent weight gain. I've tried to just eat what I want in reason to enjoy life and food, and exercise to just be fit and healthy, but I'm just lying to myself, and just can't cope with change. Its ruining my relationships, and ruining life for as a whole for me as my whole life revolves around this. I just don't know what to do any more. Does anyone have any advice or thoughts? Request: I'm worried diabetes is giving me an eating disorder 2017-04-24 02:36:46 reddit post Over a year ago, I was diagnosed with prediabetes. I immediately went on the ketogenic diet to try to not progress to type 2 diabetes, but my A1c at my check up three months later was even higher than before I cut out all sugar and carbs. At the time of my diagnosis and the time I went keto, I was was a healthy weight for my height. After then, I figured since it makes no difference, to start allowing carbs and sugar back into my diet. I started using an app to track my intake and set my goals to the recommended grams of sugar, and a number for carbs that's considered low-carb (and some random numbers for protein and fat). If I go over my grams of sugar for the day or my carbs, I feel absolutely terrible about myself, like I am a failure, and like I'm going to end up killing myself because my diabetes can, over time, destroy my body. If it matters at all, since last year, I've lost a decent percentage of my body weight without actively trying. I'm still a healthy weight, but if I lose another pound or two, my BMI will be too low. Anorexia runs in my family--both my grandmas has suffered from it and one died from it. When my parents saw me for the holiday, they kept asking me if I needed help. I guess my main question is, at one point does counting carbs and counting calories for diabetes become an actual eating disorder, since it's necessary for diabetics to survive by counting these numbers? Request: My most popular Facebook photo is of me when I was visibly very sick. How can I cope with the negative feelings this causes? 2017-04-23 23:39:11 reddit post I know it's dumb. I know that I shouldn't be looking for validation from Facebook friends. But I only have 150 friends; all whom I see in real life at least once a week. At my lowest weight, where I could barely stand, passed out walking up a half a flight of stairs, and couldn't remember day to day interactions, I posted a selfie. I rarely post photos of myself due to insecurities I have, so this was the first time in almost a year. Almost every single one of my friends liked/loved it. Told me I looked good even though my collar bones and ribs were protruding severely. My eyes were sunken in so badly that my head looked like a damn halloween prop. Shortly after posting this photo, I started recovery. Around 2 months later, I posted a photo of myself at a normal weight. Smiling, happy, no bones protruding. Hardly anyone liked it. When I confess to people about my ED and recovery, they say it was very obvious I was suffering. Yet here they were, loving on this photo of me that was essentially a breath away from death's door. I know I could just remove the photo, but I want it there as a reminder to myself. I guess I'm just baffled right now. It used to be very triggering, but now over time not so much. It is more of a lesson now. Does anyone else have similar experiences? And how do you cope with them? Request: My roommate's eating seems perfect and it's triggering me. How do I cope? 2017-04-23 23:31:46 reddit post So I am trying to get over a longstanding, mild case of bulimia. I'm somewhat healthy, only binging and purging maybe once a week, but the disorder consumes my waking thoughts, and when I do have binge and purge episode, it really throws me off for a few days and affects my self esteem. Anyway, my roommate is completely opposite of me - she eats super slowly, forgets about her food, eats a third or half, or puts away like three bites for later (whereas I devour most of the food that's in front of me - to not eat the last three bites and 'save them' for later is crazy to me). What's worse is she's now vegan and she basically doesn't buy food in plastic or things you can throw away, so I feel her eating is perfect, and it makes me feel terrible about how I eat. Basically her way of eating makes me extremely jealous, and I'm worried it's triggering me to want to eat less or similarly, which I feel would cause me to restrict then go crazy and binge later. It's stupid to feel this way. How can I get over it and just focus on myself and do what I need to to get better? Request: Non-ED related doctor visits triggering? 2017-04-20 12:00:04 reddit post I've been in and out of recovery for awhile and had been pretty good about avoiding AN behaviors lately until I had to make a doctor's appointment for horrible spring allergies. Just knowing that I'll have to be weighed in a few days has driven me straight back into restricting and anxiety about it not being low enough/being seen as faking it. My go to coping mechanisms seem to be failing me. I'd really appreciate any suggests anyone has. Thank you. Request: I'm scared that I'm emulating/spiralling into an ED 2017-04-20 11:59:13 reddit post Hey guys. I recently realized that I've been restricting (advertently and inadvertently) the food that I've been intaking for about 6 months now. I'm slightly overweight for my height, and I've recently committed to losing excess weight, but for the past 6 months, I've noticed that when I eat even a bite of something or have a snack (even if it's healthy), I feel disgusting about myself. I had one bite of tofu today to test how it turned out after cooking it, and I just felt absolutely awful about eating before my designated dinner time. Every day, I eat a lot less than the calories required to lose weight, and I've been pushing my body to burn a lot of calories each day on the treadmill. I've lost a considerable amount of weight in a short amount of time, and I'm scared that I may be spiralling into an ED. How do I stop this? I still have some weight left to lose but for some reason, my mentality is that I can lose it faster by starving, strict portion control and rigorous exercise, and that I shouldn't be dependent on food. I used to eat when I was bored, and when I wasn't even hungry, and I haven't started to feel genuinely guilty about it until now. Nowadays, food feels like an enemy or an obstacle getting in the way of a perfect body. I don't feel malnourished/tired from doing this but I'm really scared. Does anyone have any tips on how to curve this behavior? Thanks Request: Trying to find a healthier alternative for girlfriends birthday dessert 2017-04-18 15:41:00 reddit post Hey folks, I have a small request. My girlfriend used to struggle from bulimia, but fortunately, she has mostly recovered. However, she still gets uncomfortable when it comes to desserts. The main problem seems to be that she feels forced to eat desserts in social settings. Having something not too sweet on the table could solve that. Thus, for her birthday, I want to find a somewhat healthier cake or something else. There will probably be several cakes on the table, so one healthier alternative won't hurt. Any suggestions? I've only managed to come up with some vegetables and dip so far, which could work. Thanks in advance! Request: The scale routine is back 2017-04-18 12:31:44 reddit post Last week I was at the doctor's for a sinus problem, obviously told them I didn't want to know my weight, and the nurse who weighed me was totally understanding about that. BUT after the appointment, they handed me a sheet with a summary, and guess what, there was my weight, and they'd calculated my BMI as well. I've been good about not weighing myself for months. It was a difficult behavior to break, but I was doing well until now. But suddenly I'm right back to weighing myself constantly and getting freaked out every time it fluctuates upwards, and wanting to see it go down soooo bad. I know I can get back on track with help from my therapist, and of course getting that scale out of here. But I feel like emotionally I've taken a HUGE step backwards. I'm scared that I'll never completely leave my eating disorder behind because I'm triggered so easily. I hate how easy it is for something so insignificant to completely take up all of my mind. Why does this have to be so hard?!!!!! Request: Relapse help 2017-04-18 12:30:41 reddit post Hey I'm not sure if this has been posted already but it wouldn't let me put it up. Maybe someone could help or offer some advice please? Hi all, I have been debating posting this for a long time. I have had an eating disorder for around 20 years but wasn't diagnosed until around 4 years ago when I was in a very severe restriction form and lost (I don't want to put numbers in case I trigger anyone) about a third of my body weight within a few months and kept going. The thing is I regained the weight cos of all the pressure that I felt from family, friends and the health team who advised I would be sectioned if I didn't go inpatient. Now, the ED is far from gone. I'm still in the same habits of purging and controlling/restricting but not losing any weight and I feel like I want to peel off my skin and be the person I was even though I know how sick I was. I am still seeing a psychiatrist but she accepts no more than about 10-15 mins for each (8 weekly session) and even when I've told her everything including my self harm and suicidal thoughts, she barely responds and just offers to continue or infrequently up my dosage. I'm really losing the will. Can anyone help? Can anyone help me to accept help and want to recover? Please. Thank you so much, I don't want to clog the feed but just feeling pretty bad and low Edit: Please let the OP /u/mixxvixxen know when you respond. Request: binge eating problem 2017-04-16 15:54:19 reddit post how does one even go about beginning to tackle a binge eating disorder? i acknowledge that i have a problem, but even that isn't enough. i can go a whole day being "good", eating healthy, only to ruin it at night by eating nearly everything in sight until i have a headache and am breathing heavily. i feel worthless because i cannot seem to tackle this issue, which is starting to affect my mental health and well-being. if anyone could provide some tips or help for dealing with a binge eating issue i would appreciate it an insane amount. i don't know where to start but i want to conquer this disorder and overcome it once and for all. thanks for taking the time to read my story. Request: A couple in need of ED recovery tips? 2017-04-16 15:53:37 reddit post Me and my gf are both recovering from EDs. Between us we have years of experience with BED, anorexia, orthorexia... we have tried to change the way we approach food on a massive scale by eating out more talking about our feelings on food and so on, but we recently hit a wall. we realized we were rushing too fast into this and needed some help. How do we actually do this? Change our routine slightly each day? each week? how do we adjust it? We are scared and worried but we have mutual support all we need is something to guide us in the right direction. We try to measure fullness on a 1-10 scale before and after every meal. we also ditched our old rules but i think we did that too rashly and it somewhat backfired. The amount of blogs, articles and tips on the topic are overwhelming and anxiety-inducing. Also none provide real advice, like "break one more rule every week" or something concrete. We need something that will indicate that we are going in the right direction and also at a right pace. Any tips ? Tldr, we both lost a lot of weight and have developed bad habits/negative attitudes towards food Request: How to proceed with treatment when you've made progress stopping behaviors, but still have ED thoughts? 2017-04-12 01:37:57 reddit post Despite maintaining a healthy weight for 3 years after a 6 year stint with ana, I'm looking for treatment to help with the ana voice and thoughts I still experience often - feelings of worthlessness, wanting to lose weight, fear of gaining weight and overall the obsessive thought that I don't deserve to be loved - all things that have been the root cause of disordered eating in the past. When I was underweight, I found that therapy actually exacerbated my ED because it forced me to talk about food all the time. I'd like to start a treatment plan to help with the underlying issues but am scared that therapy will force me to think about food more. Has anyone else had this experience and any suggestions for tackling this next phase of treatment moving forward? I am determined to kick the ana voice out of my life. Request: I can only eat when I'm stoned. How can I re-learn to eat normally? 2017-04-09 03:23:04 reddit post i've struggled with anorexia for about ten years. for the past four years or so, i've developed a coping mechanism where i'm only able to eat when i'm stoned. when i try to eat sober, the smell of food is nauseating, and i just can't bring myself to take a bite. i really want to be able to eat under normal circumstances. does anyone else have this issue? What has helped you to overcome a dependence on substances when it comes to eating or avoiding ED symptoms? Request: Strategies to overcome ED 2017-04-05 16:32:42 reddit post I'm curious about strategies and routines that have helped people to overcome binge eating and anorexia. What has helped face and solve the issue in your life? How did you identify the triggers? By yourself, through therapy, through talking with peers? Request: How can we use our "powers" for good? 2017-04-05 16:30:48 reddit post All the perfectionism and determination...how can we put these types of things to good use in our lives instead of being obsessed with something that in reality doesn't better our futures at all? Losing weight or getting "the body you want" doesn't further our careers or make us have better relationships. If we can put our thoughts into something productive we could probably really excel. What have you found like that that takes you out of your ED head? Request: osteoporosis 2017-04-05 00:05:15 reddit post My sister has a diagnosis of osteoporosis caused by long term anorexia.(almost 20 yrs) I can't find much information about the implications of this online, only that anorexia can cause osteoporosis and there seems to be a less straight forward treatment options than other forms of osteoporosis. is there anyone else in this position or with a relative who has it? if so have they been able to increase their bone mineral density with treatment? how has it affected them? Request: How do I get over feeling like I don't deserve to eat? 2017-03-31 21:50:30 reddit post I'm very overweight (100 pounds) and I have a binge/restrict disorder. In the past, I would restrict without realizing it: "I don't have time to eat right now" or "You're probably just bored" and so on. Lately I've been feeling like eating is a privilege that I don't get to have. I'll binge or have something that isn't in my plan (soda, seconds at dinner, etc.). I won't enjoy it while I'm eating it and then when I get hungry later I'll convince myself that I don't need anything because I'll probably just fuck up again anyway. It's like I have a voice telling me that the only way to succeed with the weight loss and prevent the mistakes is to not eat at all. I love food. I'm tired of feeling guilty for eating it. How do I get over feeling like I don't deserve to eat? Request: Physiological Complications with Recovery 2017-03-31 11:06:52 reddit post I've been attempting recovery the past several months after dealing with EDNOS for about 6 years now. It's really frustrating though in that when I do eat a meal-sized meal I feel very sick afterwards, and get cramping and severe bloating. This is also triggered by certain foods such as legumes (beans) and starchy carbs (like potatoes) and any grains. The bloating is so painful for me that I have to lay down for a few hours and often nap to relieve the pain. I know this is not just a psychological thing because both my sister and my boyfriend have seen how swollen my stomach looks and are astounded by it. I thought this may be food allergies or gluten intolerance at first (although I've never had any before), but haven't been tested for it. I read online though that years of restriction can lead to the stomach shrinking and not being able to capacitate a full meal's worth of food (similar to someone who's gotten gastric bypass surgery.) I also feel a bit cloudy/sleepy and sometimes overheated post-meal. In addition to the severe bloating, sometimes if I eat a full meal and drink a few glasses of water/fluids with and after the meal I involuntarily regurgitate some of the meal (but mostly liquid.) It's almost as if my stomach is at full capacity and it pushing up and out the extra it cannot fit. I don't have a history with bulimia. So I guess my questions are if 1) Is this related to my ED and/or is it possibly related to something else? and 2) Is there anything I can do about it and if so what? Thanks x Post request: [recovery] healthy intake 2017-03-27 15:30:34 reddit post I have had a restrictive eating disorder for over 2 years now and finally decided I wanted to try to recover last month when I realized I was skipping feeling faint in classes, not able to do certain exercises, and was unable to do almost any work due to lack of energy and the feeling that my brain was shutting down despite the fact that I was a medium healthy weight. My caloric intake was extremely low and I have made an effort in the past 4 weeks to increase my calorie intake a little...I am not on the high end of a healthy weight and I feel like I don't know what is a healthy amount to eat anymore. I find since I stopped restricting I actually feel hungry more often. I still eat much healthier than the average college student but I hate the change I've seen since trying to recover from the pain of severe restricting. I have no idea what a healthy intake is anymore. Any advice? Ps: I realize a nutritionist is an option is like that to be a last resort though. Request: Should I tell my doctor? 2017-03-27 15:28:03 reddit post I suspect I may have an eating disorder - I display many symptoms such as restricting diet to lose weight, hating my body, calorie counting to an excess, a desire not to eat in front of others, etc. So should I tell my doctor? I'm underweight, but I don't think it'll get much worse and it may just be a waste of time and money. It's not very severe at the moment, so should I tell my doctor about it? Request: Doctors recommendation is making things worse? 2017-03-27 15:26:43 reddit post I very recently got dignosed with an ED and this dignosis came to a very huge surprise. and the doctor said that I should try to eat more and track what I eat or he will have to send me to a dietitian. But tracking the food I eat and seeing all the calories I eat is making it a lot harder to eat and to feel better(I feel gross at how much I eat) All these feelings are new as I've never saw my eating As a problem but I've been sick for probably 6 Years I've felt fine up until I've had to track what I'm eating for the doctor, what should I do? Or how do I make my self feel better about how much I eat? Request: Recovering while also getting to a lower, healthy weight 2017-03-27 15:24:49 reddit post Body Stats: female, 20, short, overweight Last year I tried to diet, had the "less is better" mentality, and got into the healthy range. But I was miserable, starving, and hurting. Came home for the summer, sort of snapped out of it, started eating again, but now I'm overweight again. This time, I'm trying to be healthy, make genuine lifestyle choices instead of just dieting. I've discovered I actually love vegetables. But I'm struggling with eating enough. I'm definitely doing better than last time, but some days I have to force myself to eat every bite, and most days I only eat about 3/4 as much as I'm aiming for. So how do you guys juggle moving towards a healthy weight with eating enough? Request: Has anyone been treated at the Emily Program? What was it like? 2017-03-25 02:49:57 reddit post I've had ED issues of all kinds for a long time now and I just made an appointment at The Emily Program. I understand it's a really good treatment center and it's also pretty much the only ED treatment option in my area. My major issue that's being treated is binging but I also have some restrictive tendencies too. I just wanted to know what anyone who's already been through it thought of the program so I know a little bit more about what to expect. I haven't had my assessment yet but I'm sure I'll just be doing the day program, but if you were in residential I'd still like to hear your experience! Request: Daughter's Friend has asked for our help 2017-03-25 02:48:55 reddit post Our 18 year old daughter is friend with a 17 year old girl with an eating disorder. Last night, our daughter came into our room and asked us for help. This girl's parents are divorced. Her mother appears to have a similar eating disorder and has refused to help her daughter get medical attention. This girl has asked her father for help as well and has been denied. Over the months, we have seen her lose a tremendous amount of weight. I'm not a doctor but I'm not stupid. The girl is wonderful. She does well in school, holds down a job and has been accepted at a wonderful college. Last night, my daughter told us, that her friend is now having difficulty digesting food when she does eat. My daughter asked if we would pay for a doctor to evaluate her and/or pay for an in-treatment program. My wife and I want to help and we could find the money so that's not the issue. Our problem is that this girl is 17 and not our child. How do we help her? Are we allowed to? What can we do? This is serious. This girl needs help and she's asking us. What do we do? Someone help! Research Participants Sought: Do you have an eating disorder or suspect you might have an eating disorder? Participate in our "closing the treatment gap" survey and we will donate $10 AUD to eating disorders charity 2017-03-24 01:21:10 reddit post My name is Dr. Scott Griffiths. I'm an eating disorders researcher at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Today we launched a global study of treatment attitudes, media, and stigma, among individuals with diagnosed and suspected (i.e., undiagnosed) eating disorders. The study is called ["Closing the treatment gap: A longitudinal study of treatment attitudes, media, and stigma among individuals with diagnosed or suspected eating disorders"](https://melbpsych.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Y17wI11kbstmtL). We are seeking individuals who i) are currently diagnosed with an eating disorder, or ii) think they might have an eating disorder. You must be aged 18 years and over to participate. The study initially involves a 2535 minute online survey and two shorter 1520 surveys that will be emailed to you 3 and 6 months later, respectively. We will donate $5 AUD for each of the second and third times you complete the survey and you can choose which of 7 eating disorder charities will receive your donation. The charities are located in countries around the globe, including Australia, Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. If you complete both the second and third survey, your total donation will be $10 AUD. We are seeking 500 participants. Thus, the total possible donation to eating disorder charities is $5000 AUD. The study is funded by a grant from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. [Click to learn more about the study and to participate](https://melbpsych.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Y17wI11kbstmtL). Were posting to r/EatingDisorders because our previous recruitment efforts on this subreddit were a great success. The findings from these (now published) studies led to changes in public policy in Australia, enabled charities to focus their eating disorders destigmatisation campaigns, and informed clinical workshops that trained eating disorders clinicians living in cities around the globe, from Fremantle through to New York.

Sincerely, Scott Request: Online forum where my mum can talk to other families caring for girls with eating disorders? 2017-03-23 19:55:16 reddit post My 17 year old sister has a fairly serious eating disorder. It's heartbreaking seeing her intentionally wasting away to almost nothing. She has now finally agreed to go to an eating disorders clinic and has visited once, but I'm aware that this is just the start of her road to recovery. I'm only involved when I return home (about one weekend per month), but my mum deals with it on a day-to-day basis. In an entirely separate incident she's had to deal with her divorce following my dad being arrested, and she's under a huge amount of stress as she tries to look after her children. Last time I was there she just burst into tears and told me about how difficult it was trying to look after my sister on top of everything else, and how she just didn't know what to do. The person my sister is seeing is a registered mental nurse, which is a good start, but the therapy (which is obviously confidential) only takes place between my sister and the nurse. I'm very surprised that there's no involvement for my mum at all - she's not received any guidance whatsoever on how to act, is not going to be involved in any group counselling, and is still feeling very much in the dark. Does anyone know of an online forum where my mum can direct her worries towards people who are going through a similar thing? She's in desperate need of a support system that I'm just not knowledgeable enough to provide. Request: Eating issues 2017-03-23 19:48:58 reddit post So Im guy whos 20 years old and I have this problem that has been bugging me for a while. Anyway I'm skinny as hell which is quite embarrassing for me. I wanted to ask if I should see doctor about it since I dont know if its serious or not. I cant eat much, there are some times when I can eat alot but these happen rarely. Usually I just eat to get rid of empty stomach feel because I dont wanna force myself. (I have tried to force more food but its kinda giving me throw up feel sometimes). Recently I havent eaten much at all due to some emotional issues. I heard that doing exercises and working out gives more hunger feel but for me it works opposite. Every time I do something physical I just dont feel hunger at all after working and it takes like 1-2 hours to get my hunger feel. So should I see doctor about it or its just some genetical issue? Request: Doctor said I have an eating disorder and I didn't know 2017-03-23 16:46:35 reddit post I went to the doctors a day ago from unrelated issues and he asked about my eating because I am underweight, cold and have a very low resting heart rate, he said that all this can and is related to eating disorders and that I probably have one. Now I've never thought of my self having an ED but I have always had strange habits with food like having to eat things a certain way always even on equal when chewing and with bite sizes and I know I don't eat as much as I should and I can't eat in front of people I don't know or when I'm in public or if I'm in a quiet room. My question is can I have a eating disorder and not even know about it? He says that my malnutrition is affecting my brain function and not helping with my severe anemia and would like to test me again for depression and anxiety and send me to a dietitian so I'd really love to know if I could actually have a eating disorder. Request: Is going from severely underweight to overweight a common occurrence? 2017-03-23 15:48:36 reddit post I have had a restrictive ED. Last April I was my perfectly healthy usual self (I used to hover around the bottom of the healthy BMI range), while in December I reached a really low BMI. At the beginning of March my dietitian, seeing that I wasn't gaining weight even if I weren't actively restricting anymore, told me that I was "allowed" to eat just as much as I wanted and I just had to follow my hunger without ever counting calories. That's what I did. I ate a lot. Like, really a lot. I gained all my weight back in three weeks. But I'm keeping on eating a lot and now I'm really, truly f*cking scared that I'm going to end up overweight. My dietitian says it's close to impossible since I have a "lean body type" and I've never been overweight in my life (heck, I've never even been in the upper healthy range!). My mother and all my family also say the same. But I just can't believe them. I'm eating like crazy. I'm not exactly binging, I'm just eating a lot, definitely more than what I should eat to maintain my current weight. I'm absolutely convinced that I'm going to keep on gaining weight and become fat. Is that a common occurence among anorexic people, or more broadly people with a history of restrictive ED? My friends think I have an eating disorder. Are they right to worry? 2017-03-21 02:36:04 reddit post Recently I went on an overnight trip for school. This was the first time I ate with most of the team, and they seemed really concerned about me eating only two meals a day. I also had a mini-freakout when I realized the single item I'd eaten from Dairy Queen had more than half the calories I normally eat in a day. Even if I do experience some sort of disordered eating, I'm seeing a school counselor soon, so I could bring it up then. However, I really don't want my friends to worry about my eating. Eating more food seems like the worst option -- is there any other way I could convince them I'm okay? Request: Advice for a housemate 2017-03-20 12:01:24 reddit post She has dropped a massive amount of weight and she wasn't anywhere near an average weight before. She puts up signs in her cupboard in order to stop herself eating, and she recently asked me to go into her room to get something and there was a hand-written sign with aggressive "thinspiration" messages on her wall. There has been other signs but this one is the most aggressive one. She only has bottled water in her section of the fridge. It's a worry to say the least, nothing has been said to her up to this point but it is of great concern as she is always commenting how all of her clothes are loose on her (remember I said she wasn't an average weight before hand), even items of clothing such as stretchy leggings are loose on her. Just looking for advice as to whether I need to speak to her in order for her to start getting help? FYI I'm not a jealous female friend of hers that's envious of her weight loss, I'm a concerned male housemate that has nothing to gain or lose regardless of the outcome of all this. Request: Do I actually have an ED? 2017-03-17 11:09:43 reddit post I had a mild eating disorder when I was younger. My mom was very into crossfit and encouraged a restricted diet. I was always underweight, but it was never intentional. I never weighed myself and I was always involved in dancing/ cheerleading/ staying in shape. Over the last year or so, I've had a lot of family drama and financial stress and I'm struggling to find a way to get through school. I've noticed that my sleeping and eating patterns are very out of whack. I don't know if this is just stress, or an indicator of a bigger issue at work. I have lost a little too much weight in the last few months, and I think I might be underweight, but I've always had a small frame, so I really don't know. That in itself wouldn't worry me so much if I had a normal appetite. Per the weight-height-range chart sited here, I'm technically "ok", but I feel like my behavior might not be. I've found I rarely have an appetite, and usually the thought of any kind of food sounds repulsive. I've also found myself more concerned about the number on the scale (my boyfriend left his at my apartment) and how I look in the mirror... It's not really a conscious decision not to eat or self restrict, but I've had so much trouble gaining weight and I've felt a lot of guilt if I go crazy on a meal, like eating an entire pizza, but I've never made myself vomit. I am vegetarian (by choice) and gluten free (celiac), so obviously that comes with some diet struggles in itself. I know that seeing a therapist or psychiatrist is the best option, but unfortunately it's just something I can't afford. Has anyone else had any similar issues? How do you deal with them? Request: Restrictive eating causing horrible anxiety. Need help 2017-03-15 20:39:50 reddit post I'm working on the recovery process from anorexia b/p subtype and still have some bad days. When my intake is less-than-adequate, my anxiety shoots through the roof. I can barely get myself to work, I'm worried about everything, I get so frustrated at the smallest things, and I feel completely unsettled. These feelings of inadequacy drive me to restrict further, perpetuating the cycle. Has anyone found techniques or medications that help? I'm currently on Wellbutrin and seeing a therapist. Any advice would be massively appreciated. Thanks! Request: How should I support an online friend with an ED whom I've never met in person 2017-03-15 03:45:39 reddit post Recently someone I know online and have grown very close to over the past several years confided in me that she has an eating disorder. I had suspected the possibility when she would mention miniscule changes in her weight and stressed about it when in reality she did not appear to have gained at all and already appeared to me as being healthy in her weight. Also from what she talked about eating, I got the idea that she was barely getting enough calories in a day. She also recently started exercising regularly, and frequently compares herself to skinnier girls who barely look like they weigh any less than she does. Eventually it came up that she admitted she has been struggling with an eating disorder for some time. I did not wish to pry too deep into her condition for fear of asking the wrong questions or steering the conversation into a dark place. I did learn that her issue is forcing herself to purge after meals, however I do not know the frequency, if it's after binging or just "sometimes". She did mention that she was proud of herself for going three days without an incident, and that the night prior she even had a meal that made her feel "full" but she didn't allow herself to throw up afterwards. She also told me she's only told 3 other people about her disorder because of how gross she thought it was. She seems to understand her problem, and acknowledges it is a problem, but she said she didn't really know how to stop herself. My response to this was that I was happy to hear of her recent progress, and thanked her for sharing this with me as I know admitting something like this can be very difficult. I also told her I only wanted to support her and for her to be happy and healthy, and she can lean on me in any way she needs. But the fact that I'm not accessable in person and we only really speak online sparsely a few times a week means I feel very limited in what I can do. Since then we haven't really spoken about this directly and I'm unsure about how I can check in with her to make sure she's doing okay. I did not ask her if she is now or ever has received counseling for this, but I would like that to be the next thing I ask if I can find a way to talk to her about this again. I get the impression, however, that she is trying to do this alone which I'm sure is incredibly difficult and greatly hinders her chances of success. Today we spoke and in the short conversation all of the signals were present that she's still struggling. She mentioned gaining a few pounds recently, and shortly after mentioning how full she was after eating a salad she ended the conversation saying she had something to take care of. I've been stressing ever since with the thought that she left to purge. I'm afraid to be the one to bring it up again because I don't want her to push me away. I already feel like in the few weeks since her admission she's been slightly more distant with me, as if she possibly feels awkward with me knowing and possibly regretting telling me. Of course I also realize her distance could just be in my own head and I'm over analyzing something that isn't there. She's also in her final week of school for this semester and I fear that any unwanted confrontation on the subject might put her under even more stress. I'm not exactly sure what kind of help I'm asking for here, or expecting. I don't want to lose a friend, but I also don't want to do nothing. Any advice would be appreciated. Request: Helping my friend who lives abroad 2017-03-14 02:46:40 reddit post A very good friend of mine suffers from bulimia. As far as I know, I'm the only one who knows about it. I've known for about a year and tried to help her find help. I know that it's almost impossible to get someone to get help for themselves if they don't want it but I'm really concerned about her health. She's still at a healthy weight, but her mental health suffers a lot from her struggles. What can/should I do to help her? She lives abroad, so I can only talk to her via phone and I don't know how insurance/counseling works in her country. Request: nightly binge eating syndrome 2017-03-14 02:45:22 reddit post I need help to fight this, I'm sick and tired of what im going through. Can anyone offer advice? Request: How will my girlfriend's behaviour change as she recovers? 2017-03-13 10:28:25 reddit post My girlfriend of a few months is still on the road to fully recovering. She saw a dietitian recently who told her that because she's still undereating, she doesn't have the sex drive normal to a 23 year old. I fully intend to continue supporting her, but that does worry me slightly. We're taking things very slow, because we're both committed to no sex before marriage, but what does that mean for us as a couple? As she continues to recover, could she realise that she's not actually attracted to me? I've heard of people coming off birth control, and when their hormones change, they lose attraction to their partner as a result. I know that being underweight and undereating can also affect your hormones, but is this something that could happen? Thank you in advance. Request: Sponsors? 2017-03-13 10:27:21 reddit post In recovery but struggling, and would really benefit from having a positive, "recovered" role model who can support me.

Request: How do i stop? 2017-03-12 11:40:47 reddit post Long story short. I'm a male 24 and had cancer treatment and stemcell transplant at age 9. Got GvH and it scarred my body. I was bullied and left very insecure about my body, looks and weight. Was almost overweight BMI wise but my body composition is quite twisted so yeah. Wanted to lose some weight and did. Too much. Now im severely underweight and feel stuck. I'm currently in outpatient contact with a ED clinic. My weight had risen a little during a few months but because i started abusing a medicine my weight has dropped again. Half by accident really. Lower than it has ever been. But still i feel as worse as always. I can't look into the mirror or even my shadow. At school i can't take off my scarf to hide my face. How do i stop? I think i look like a monster. Others say it's all in my head but it really doesn't matter as long as i see myself that way. Request: Weight is Stabilizing 2017-03-07 21:52:38 reddit post I won't exactly say I binge, but I do purge everyday at least once. Recently I've noticed that nothings really changing and that my weight has stabilized. Is there anyway I can bypass this stage and lose a little bit more weight? I want to seek help with some of my friends but it's really hard because I'm a guy and I can still be skinnier. I also feel like I'm a huge baggage every time I go to one if my friends and talk about it. Sigh Request: How should I help my BN friend more? 2017-03-07 21:51:22 reddit post I have been supporting my friend with BN for about 8 months now. I bring her food (we're college students), hang out and talk about her state of mind, trying to encourage her to be more positive about herself. It has felt like a long road and she tells me she feels happier around me and more outgoing in her plans, but at the same time I wonder if there is more I can do. Several things worry me: 1) When I stop by, her toilet has these thick black stains along the side. I thought they were blood, but I'm not sure. Her situation was critical years ago, but not now, so I'm wondering if this is normal. 2) Since I help her get food, I was wondering if there is anything I can get her to protect her teeth. She is fully aware of many of the downsides, but even then I can see stains on her teeth and think about how they're eroding every day. Any techniques or products you guys use on your teeth? 3) Should I nag her to eat less sugar? Considering the acid damage, eating sugar only compounds further damage upon the enamel. I don't want to become annoying though. 4) She tells me she feels like she deserves what she endures as some form of punishment for not accepting her body, which I really struggle to understand, but is this a common thought in your experience? 5) Is recovery common? God I hope so. Eventually I'm going to have to move away, and she'll be left on her own. I try to run all the outcomes in my head and they're not ideal. Unless she stops now, I forsee lifelong damage, but it's frustrating because I realized long ago it can't be stopped in a day. I guess this is also a vent. I know I'm doing good by helping her, but with the physical damage still being done I feel like I'm doing nothing for her long term health. Again, her weight has increased marginally since I met her, but I just struggle with my own impatience for a quicker resolution. Sorry for the long post. If you're reading this my friend, know that you are not alone. you are loved. I love you. Request: I think my sister has an eating disorder 2017-03-07 04:13:58 reddit post Nearly everyone in my family has some kind of mental illness. I have anorexia, and another relative has a binge/restrict eating disorder. Lately I've been worried about my youngest sister. She doesn't like her body, and lately she's been skipping a lot of meals. I've talked to our parents, and they've agreed to take her to a therapist because she's been showing other signs of anxiety, but they don't think her eating is a problem because "she's not underweight". (they also think I'm all cured from my disorder because I'm not underweight anymore) So obviously they're clueless. I'm glad she's going to therapy, because that is a good first step. But I know from my own experience that it's not going to be enough. Recovery is only possible if you really want to recover, and I don't know if my sister does or not. And even if she does, it's really hard in a family environment as messed up as ours. I'm worried about my sister, and I want to help her. But I don't know what to do, and I know I can't handle the burden of being her only support outside of therapy. Her eating habits are actually really triggering me to restrict as well. What can I do to improve this situation??? Request: Found out my girlfriend is anorexic, I want to help however I can 2017-03-05 23:35:38 reddit post My girlfriend accidentally came out as anorexic to me. I discovered her private tumblr blog that she uses to post thinspo and tips for others. She sent a message to me through that blog by accident, but I haven't told her I saw it, and she blocked my account from that blog shortly after. Neither of us have said a word so far. I've been in relationships before with people suffering from mental illness, but I've never dealt with an eating disorder, and I'm clueless. I want to make sure I help how I can while avoiding making things worse or creating a toxic relationship. It doesn't seem like she wants to be treated, as she frequently requested meanspo on her blog, and encouraged fasting. Also from what I can tell, she doesn't seem to be as severe as others I've seen with the disorder. She hasn't fasted around me, and she and I have enjoyed big meals together. However I'm now worried those meals were her binges. I need whatever advice you all have, please. I care for her and I want to do what I can. Thank you Request: How long should I wait before working out again? (AN Recovery) 2017-03-05 22:49:59 reddit post Question for those who have experience with ED recovery (anorexia to be specific) and working out. Before my ED, I used to be really healthy. Was at a normal BMI, ate lots of healthy food, and used to run! I loved running. It was a great way to destress. But as my ED reared its head, I gave it up because I was too tired and underweight to even walk up a flight of stairs, let alone run a few miles. I think that's when my ED really got out of control; I wasn't able to do things that made me happy, so I turned to restriction. I'm on the path to recovery, and it's been going well! I'm still underweight, but if I continue this meal plan I should be in a normal range within the next week or two! I've been eating a lot more and I'm eating healthy foods and foods that make me happy. My body dysmorphia is starting to disappear and I'm seeing now that I was truly happy back when I was taking proper care of myself and my body. I would love to start running again, but my question to everyone is how long should I wait? My doctor says to reach my goal weight first and then we'll go from there. I plan on doing that. But I'd like to hear about everyone's personal experiences with it, since it sounds like there's a lot more going into it than simply reaching a healthy BMI. I never used running as a way to restrict, but I know it could easily become a form of restriction if I'm not careful after reaching my goal weight. But I really like how I felt and how I could zone out, listen to music, and destress. Does anyone have any possible insight? When did you feel comfortable working out again? Any experiences to share? Etc. :) Thank you so much in advance! You guys have been wonderful! 3 Request: Need some perspective about possible eating disorder 2017-03-05 03:00:19 reddit post I used to go to the pediatrician who would tell me every year that I was on the edge of being overweight for my height. She told me to exercise more which I generally didn't listen to, but since she, my parents, PE teachers and more subtly from others around me always were kind of pointing to the fact that I needed or would be better if I lost weight. For a long time, I didn't do anything about it. I didn't really change any of my habits with regards to exercising or eating but since being in college where I don't have parents or teachers looking over me and mandatory family meals or lunch periods to go to, I began to eat twice a day. Now, I'm at a study abroad program where students have to prepare meals for themselves or go out since there isn't a cafeteria and so while I still eat twice a day, I eat kind of small meals. Recently, I've for the first time noticed that if I splurge and eat more when I go out I feel super gross the following day in ways that I haven't before. I'm by no means skinny, not super obsessed with my meals or a diet. It kind of just happens that I eat relatively little, but I definitely have lost weight but I don't feel prettier or happier or even healthier like my family or PE teachers/pediatrician suggested I would. I'm wondering if it's worth bringing up with a mental health professional or my GP or I'm just too lazy to feed myself three times a day. Request: I found out a classmate of mine has an eating disorder- what should I do? 2017-03-04 01:14:47 reddit post I was changing in the locker room at school and 2 girls next to me were as well. They were having a conversation about food and exercise that was a bit worrisome (one of the girls has struggled with AN in the past), but there was no concrete evidence that they were suffering. Then, one of the girls mentioned that a friend of theirs (let's call her Anna) had told them she was restricting. The number she told them was VERY worrisome to me. Should I bring this up to a guidance counselor? I'm not very close with Anna, but what I heard gave me cause to be extremely worried. I don't want her to be resentful if she finds out I was the one to tell someone. Request: Do I have an eating disorder or am I making things up? 2017-03-04 01:02:42 reddit post Hi everyone I'm a 5'0, 19 year old girl and I've been trying to figure out if I have an eating disorder or not. This might be a bit lengthy but please bear with me! I've been overweight for most of my life. My weight struggles began when I was about 8 years old, I would cry while staring at my belly . Ever since then weight has always been a problem, I started purging when I was 15, at the time I thought it was a "genius" idea because I can eat and still lose weight, I would also exercise every. single. day. Everything after that is a bit of a blur because I wouldn't stick to purging but I would also search for other weight loss methods such as calorie counting. One of the most defining moments for me was when I moved to my home country for two months, I was completely alone and I could spend 2 hours in the bathroom purging with no one bothering me, there were also days where I just wouldn't eat. Fast forward to January 2016 I went back to living with my parents and of course I gained all the weight back it was so distressing and I wanted to lose weight again and eventually I did. I lost a lot of weight in 3-4 months, first it started out as a "harmless" diet and the weight loss was facilitated by the fact that I was fasting the month of Ramadan, then I went on a vacation to my home country (which I realize is triggering), I was extremely depressed and barely ate or I purged the small amounts of food I ate. I was there for 3 weeks and lost more weight, food caused so much anxiety and my parents were becoming worried. My dad who is a doctor thought I was developing anorexia for a while he even suspected that I was purging he confronted me numerous times including a month ago but I kept denying it. After my vacation I started leaning towards veganism, I convinced myself that it was for the environment and my health but I think it has manifested itself into my mentality for example I fear eating foods made with animal products and whenever one of my friends tries to force me to eat I start panicking and purge all the food I eat sometimes even in my university bathrooms. Recently I started experiencing hair loss, my hairline is receding and I always have to unclog the shower, I missed my period for 3 months and although I do get it now I'm losing an abnormal amount of blood and Im thinking I might be anemic especially because I try to eat a very small number of calories a day so I'm definitely not getting my iron requirements. Not fitting one category or another of eating disorders is very confusing (could it be EDNOS?) and I'm at a very normal weight for my height so I really dont know what to think, I keep telling myself that I just need to eat more but I can't do it and when I do I find myself purging. I should also add that I never had binging episodes where I ate vary large number of calories, my binges have always been really really small but I still purge right after. I'm at a constant war with myself and I keep telling myself that I'm not bad enough, so I would really appreciate any comments, I just need some clarity. Thanks! Request: How to fix lack of appetite? 2017-03-03 12:37:51 reddit post I have dealt with anorexia on and off for about 3 years. I was in therapy for a long time, but I recently moved out of my parents house, to a new city 150 miles away. I thought I was doing well enough dealing with it on my own; I was so motivated for awhile to gain the weight back. But recently I've been slipping. I want to get better. I know I should be getting better. But I just.. can't? I have no appetite, no motivation, no plan. I'm worried that I want to get better for other people, not myself. That the guy I'm seeing will find me more attractive if I was heavier. But if my mom wasn't nagging me, if my dad hadn't yelled at me, I probably wouldn't have even tried to recover. If I had been left on my own I don't know if I would have tried at all. My story is so long and complex, I don't know if it's worth writing it all out. I don't think it matters too much right now. I'm sick of dealing with this. I want to be healthy. But I can't bring myself to eat. My friend has helped me write out meal plans. My therapist suggested setting alarms for when I have to eat. But I can't. I'm never hungry, I have 0 motivation, and I'm worried that I've already caused long term, irreversible damage to my body. My only idea now is to find some sort of in patient clinic. But I don't think I'm sick enough for something like that. And my family can't afford it, plus, I can just see them getting angry, asking things like "why can't you just eat??" (Which my dad has already said, on several occasions). Any advice is appreciated. I can provide more background if needed, I just didn't want to end up writing an entire novel. I don't think therapy will help. It honestly didn't help much before. Thanks for reading this far Request: I feel alone and need advice 2017-03-03 12:36:08 reddit post Last winter ive been really sick I'd always throw up and stuff like that then i started viewing eating not pleasing anymore then i started eating less and less, I didnt felt like eating anymore. I'd always almost throw up whenever i eat. I've also had throat surgeries which make it not always pleasant eating. During that winter i've lost so much weight but it wasnt what i wanted. Since then I gained almost the double. I am now overweight slightly , i am complexed about my weight but not to the point i dont want to eat. I live in a little region and my psychiatrist told me there werent much to do and it left me kinda hopeless. When im under stress of depressed I significantly undereat. I've started noting everything i eat to see how much i eat. I always feel faint , dehydrated, i noticed my hair grows really fast and im more hairy than usual ( which complex me much cause ive always been a bit hairy but now this is really bothering me ). I also feel like my face and throat is swollen. So yes i feel alone in all this and I'd love to get in touch with anyone who went that way and kicked eating disorder . I also wonder if i eat enough daily the hair will fall or at least stop growing? Thanks for reading Request: I'm unsure what to do at this point. 2017-03-02 00:23:08 reddit post I've been overeating a lot in the past couple of months. More so then I believe I was at any point in my life (I've always been obsessed with food). I want to get help because I'm overweight. I already have a therapist but god knows what she can do to help since I don't think she specializes in eating disorders. The amount I eat when I'm stressed is bare minimum twice what I normally eat, it's especially bad when I have constant access to a kitchen. I don't know who I should be contacting or anything but I need to start somewhere and soon. Request: 'Extreme' hunger during early stages of AN/underweight recovery? 2017-02-27 12:21:57 reddit post Hi everyone. I am in the early stages of AN recovery. Went from being morbidly obese to severely underweight in 2+ years time. I got to a healthy point, but then I bounced from one ED to the next. Now in the early stages of recovery with a meal plan. I am very underweight, so at first this increase food intake was very hard to do. But now I'm on day 2 and for some reason it doesn't feel like enough? After dinner I became very hungry, and while I didn't completely binge I ate more than the meal plan which used to be hard to meet. I still have a lot of weight to gain so I know it's not necessarily a bad thing at this point, but I'm worried that if I deviate from the meal plan continuously these hunger pangs will turn into binges and I'll end up going back to morbidly obese. Help? Advice? Suggestions? Has anyone else experienced this? Should I just go with it?

My dietitian will soon give me a meal plan, but I already know that it won't be enough to make me feel fully satiated. I am ALWAYS hungry. No matter what, how or when I eat, I'm hungry. I could literally finish whole boxes of cookies, cereals, crackers, pasta, chocolate, or whole loaves of bread, whole cakes, you name it. The ONLY reason why I don't do it is because I'm still obsessively counting calories and I know that if I did it I would completely panic and feel horribly guilty for days. But I'd really love to do it, and I'm afraid one day I'll snap and just binge on everything available in the kitchen. So, should I just let it all go and listen to my hunger without any restriction whatsoever? Would that be useful? Request: Struggling with trying to eat and gain weight? 2017-02-25 12:36:17 reddit post I am underweight,i feel like i eat really well,i eat a lot,i force myself to eat, so I can gain some weight. I do sports and I feel weak,i need more force and strength But often,i am really not hungry. And sometimes when I eat,my gag reflex kicks in and i have to spit my food before I throw up. I am struggling to gain weight but it is so hard to me, and I don't know what to do. I gained a little weight by eating a lot,even when I didn't feel like. But i lose it easily. And I can't keep up with this,forcing myself to eat every time to get to a healthy range weight and maintain it. It's not too comfortable.. Sorry for my english..Do you have any advice ? Request: End insatiable desire to eat sweets; how do I make this go away? 2017-02-25 12:32:42 reddit post I chew gum like a chainsmoker to fill desire to eat candy and ice cream etc. If I do not have the gum, I get the strong urge to eat cookies, candy, ice cream, etc. Then I sometimes want to binge. If I'm eating at maintenance or deficit or surplus it's always there. I have been overweight in the past so I do feel this is my previous bodyweight fighting to come back. How do I make this go away? Request: Advice for talking to my wife about her diet 2017-02-23 16:00:01 reddit post As a teen, my wife went through a period of a few months of excessive food restriction. Since then, her intake has been mostly reasonable, but she still has a tendency towards irrational thoughts about food and overindulging (I don't think it really qualifies as binging) on the weekend. She's in her early 30s now. For the last few years, she's been lifting weights after I taught her how and gave her a routine. She asked me about diet, but I told her I thought it was best she didn't worry about her diet. Recently she's gained a few pounds of bodyfat. She's still normal weight, and I think she looks fine, but she is very upset about it. She is repeatedly asking me why she's gaining weight despite her weight training and what she can do about it. Well, the answer isn't complicated: she eats a pretty hefty amount of calories on the weekend, and she would need to bring that down to a reasonable level. I haven't told her that; I've been doing a combination of 1. telling her she looks great and she shouldn't worry about it, and 2. just brushing her off. So what I'm wondering is, given that her history of disordered eating seems a lot milder than some other people, can I give her a couple suggestions about her diet without risking her blowing it up into some irrational excessively restrictive thing? And if I shouldn't do that, what should I say to her when she gets so upset about her weight gain? Request: How to respond to "How are you so tiny?" and similar comments 2017-02-22 19:46:53 reddit post Someone asked me this the other day and I had no idea how to respond, especially since I'm trying to gain weight. I know these are supposed to be positive attributes in today's society, and that these people don't know what's going on, but it does perpetuate the idea that "tiny" is good, and that I shouldn't try to gain weight. How do you respond to these/react to them/ not let them affect your recovery? Request: Teen Daughter 2017-02-21 03:27:38 reddit post My 17 year old daughter is in week 4 of a residential program. She restricts as well as purges. She was doing well the first few weeks, but has been severely restricting the past 4 or 5 days. She says she feels hopeless and doesn't really want to get well. She has so much to live for. She is going to the college of her choice in the fall--if she is well enough. What can we do to help her? I appreciate any and all suggestions! Request: Not sure if I have a problem or not 2017-02-21 03:25:17 reddit post Hey, so I'm currently overweight, and I've been trying to lose weight, but I think I might be having issues with eating properly and not simply dieting. I feel very guilty about eating, and can't stand seeing my calorie count, even when it's not that high. This led to short periods of time (a few days) where I skipped out on eating or barely ate even when I felt very hungry out of guilt. Eating a full meal rather than something simple also makes me feel bad, and I'm convinced eating anything that actually makes me feel full will cause me to gain weight. At the same time, I've also considered making myself throw up several times, and I have made two unsuccessful attempts at it. The urge to make myself throw up is particularly strong after I eat too much, I guess because I see it as a way of "resetting". Does it sound like I may have a problem? And do you have any advice, if I do have a problem? I've considered telling others, but my father just ignored me when I told him, and I worry that I'm just making a big deal out of nothing. Request: Masters Degree Research study to try and improve treatments for eating and related disorders 2017-02-19 23:09:13 reddit post Im currently conducting a study for my Masters of Clinical Psychology thesis at the Cairnmillar Institute to try to better understand the relationship between personality, emotions, self-concept, and obsessive and eating behaviours. I'm hoping that the results of this study will help to inform more effective treatments of eating and related disorders in the future. The study is open to participants (no diagnosis needed) aged 18 or above and is completely voluntary and confidential. If you choose to take part, you will be asked to complete questions about demographic information, personality traits, eating behaviours, how you view yourself, and how you cope with distressing emotions.

I used to have an eating disorder in high school I went on a diet that started as a cleanse (almost entirely fruits and vegetables) Sometimes I'd eat ice cream after dinner but then I'd be mad at myself and sometimes try to throw up. I was also always obsessively excersising The only time I ate healthy was right before a track meet. Yes I know this was totally an eating disorder. I ended up dropping down to my lowest weight possible. I got so many compliments and I loved my body for once. When I stopped eating that poorly I gained a lot of weight. Anywho today I sit a bit overweight and i have been working hard to get off. I track calories with my fitbit and I'm obsessed it it honestly effects my whole mood. If I eat good that day I'm happy and proud of myself if I go over calories I'm sad and anxious and scared to gain weight. If I go out and cant find the calories prior to going out I obsess about what I'm eating. Sometimes I think about throwing up still and sometimes. I think about going back to the way I was because I was never so confident. And then I think stupid shit like if I really had an eating disorder Id be skinny so I must not have one. I don't know how to combat this because I want to continue to lose weight and im afraid if I talk to anyone about it they will tell me not too. I'm unsure if I still have an issue and need advice. Request: Why see a nutritionist/dietician? 2017-02-18 01:15:30 reddit post I've been dealing with disordered eating ever since I was a child and it's been untreated for all these years. I'm now in therapy for some childhood trauma and my eating is more disordered than it has been in a few years (mostly restrictive). My therapist suggested I see a nutritionist/dietician but I just don't know how that will help me. Does anyone have any advice or experiences they are willing to share? Request: Unable to decide on food; is this an eating disorder? 2017-02-18 01:14:27 reddit post When I want to eat or snack, I usually know what I want. Some other food always pops up though, and then I can't decide which to have. Usually one is a hot food and one is cold (like soup vs. cereal, for example.) After I make my decision and eat, I still crave whatever my other option was, even if I'm not hungry... and I still eat it anyway. I have an obsessive compulsive disorder, so I wonder if this could be somehow connected, but I haven't seen or heard anything about the two possibly being related; it just sort of feels like it does when I need to do something OCD-like. I also have what I consider to be a fairly serious digestive system problem. I take food in, but it doesn't come out. When I'm eating this way, it only makes things worse, especially when I can literally feel food stopping in my stomach because there's a pile up. We still haven't found the cause or even a working treatment. If this does add up to be a disorder, what kinds of doctors/specialists should I seek out? I know people usually start with their regular family doctor, but that's not an option for me. Are there any articles out there I can read for more help/understanding? Request: How to ask for help 2017-02-15 13:09:30 reddit post I have a doctor's appointment coming up soon so I should hopefully begin to get help that way, and my boyfriend is being so supportive. One thing I'm terrified of, but feel will help, is to ask my brother and sister-in-law for help too. But i don't know how to open up to them about my eating issues or anything.. Any suggestions? Request: Binge Eating Disorder? Need Opinions 2017-02-15 11:20:31 reddit post I have always struggled with my relationship with food. Sometimes I eat very normally, and other times I eat barely enough because I'm just not hungry. And other times it's like my stomach never ends and I just want and could eat everything. These eating phases usually last about a week and a half at a time. The part that btohers me is the part where I just feel like I can't stop eating. I often get embarrassed and will eat a lot before my boyfriend gets home or when I am out. I could three plates of dinner if I wanted to. This has been a struggle for me for as long as I can remember. I remember my mom telling my I couldn't eat a whole box of granola bars in one day because people just don't do that. I am not that conscious of my actual body, as I do not look overweight and have a decent figure, however I would like to feel healthy and like I have control over my body for once. Do you guys have any tips or tricks for helping me with this? Request: Doctor who can monitor what I am eating? 2017-02-14 01:38:37 reddit post I feel that I have been suffering from restrictive eating for the last couple months and was hopping to ask for help on finding medical help on my diet. I have already taken blood test that didn't show any problems as well as seeing a nutritionist about what a person like me should eat regularly. Except I feel that to recover I need to eat a larger amount then a regular person would have to eat every day. Not to get into too much detail but the last couple weeks I was starting to feel better eating a large amount of calories everyday while feeling upset about weight gain. I read an article online that talked how someone like myself would need to eat a certain minimum to recover. And I was starting to recover until recently as I got better I told myself it would be alright to cut back on the calories which led me to feeling extremely foggy and fatigued today. I feel that I will continue to recover now that I will not cut back on the calories even if I start to feel better but I was hopping to get help on finding some kind of doctor that could help oversee what I am eating. Like a nutritionist who specializes in eating disorder recovery. Can anyone suggest how I might find a doctor or other professional to help me? Request: Dislike of spending money slowing recovery 2017-02-14 01:35:18 reddit post I've been doing reasonably well with recovery so far on the whole, but I feel as if I'm relapsing in the past few weeks. Going food shopping is one of my biggest triggers. I become overwhelmed by the amount of stuff and the general supermarket environment (though the supermarket I go to is hardly particularly big), get confused and agitated, and I get anxious about the amount of money I need to spend to maintain a healthy, reasonably-filling, vaguely enjoyable diet. The thing is that I do, in theory, have enough money for it. While I don't get much - I'm a PhD Student living on grant money - it's perfectly adequate to live comfortably in the part of the country I'm in. What I dislike is the act of spending so much money on something so temporary and fleeting. The act of buying food just to then eat it and it's gone frustrates me, when I'd far rather spend it on something that will bring me much longer happiness and joy (something food gives me very little of, since cooking and eating is a chore to me). I don't eat what I consider a particularly expensive diet. I just feel bad about it regardless. Does anybody else have any experience with this or any strategies to get over this block? Request: How to handle guilt and anxiety during recovery 2017-02-11 23:43:07 reddit post I am recovering from a restrictive ED. My dietitian told me that I am still not gaining weight like I should - well, technically I lost weight in the last two weeks, but it was only a pound so it may very well be a meaningless oscillation - and that I really should allow myself a little bit more food. I tried to follow his advice today. I ate a little more. Now I feel like a disgusting fat pig who's just destined to become extremely obese and I am counting over and over again in my head all the calories I took in, thinking how stupid I was, how should I have avoided that food or that other food etc. I am terribly scared and I feel deeply guilty. I'm already thinking about compensating tomorrow, even if I rationally know I shouldn't. How can I handle such destructive thoughts? How can I relieve my huge, endless stress and just enjoy an abundant meal - which wasn't even that abundant by any normal person's standards, I guess? Request: Veganism or eating disorder? 2017-02-09 03:39:33 reddit post My friend is a proud vegan, and often talks about the environmental and healthy benefits of her diet. However, I'm afraid something else is going on beneath the surface. It's not just that she thinks not eating anything from animals is better for her and the environment, she says she literally couldn't make herself eat anything from animals even if she tried to. It literally disgusts her. When she's in restaurants, she's afraid that someone might add a hint of something non-vegan in her meal or drink, just to mess with her. It would make her feel dirty, and this is what makes me worried. Though she often talks about environmental issues and animal welfare (though only in their relationship to veganism), she is not interested in political discussions about regulating meat farming. She wouldn't care enough to support a bill reducing carbon emissions, or support a farm where animals suffered less. Her main objective is always to not eat anything from animals. For example, she says she don't drink milk because the cows suffer so much, but the only solution she sees is to not drink milk, not to help the cows in any other way. She also shows no interest in other issues involving the environment (like green energy) or animal rights (like the fur and cosmetic industry). Not that she has to care about everything, but her decisions are ALWAYS concluded by whether it's vegan or not, not if it's good for her, animals, or the environment. When she goes on holidays she puts a lot of additional stress on her family, who always has to locate vegan food for her. Still, her family denies any discussions about her veganism (like the one I'm starting here), out of fear of upsetting her. Since she loves to read books, I've been told not to mention that some glues used for bookbindings are produced from horses, fearing she will give up reading altogether. She had a bad concussion a year ago, and is very often moody and exhausted. Which is not uncommon with bad concussions, but I'm not 100% sure it's not something else as well... Is my friend a stubborn environmentalist and animal rights activist with a bad concussion, or is there something more sinister at work? If not an eating disorder, maybe some purity complex, or anxiety of losing control? Please help! Request: experience with facial misperception 2017-02-08 02:24:44 reddit post I have AN, actively struggling and doing well (recently hit a healthy weight!), and BN, clean for a few months now. In addition to stomach/chest distortion, it's happened many times that I look at myself in the mirror or see a picture of myself and the facial features are distorted. My nose/chin/forehead look abnormally large, my eyes move position or rotate, my mouth changes shape or gets very wide, things like that. This has sometimes happened at times coinciding with other body image issues and I assume there's a good chance the two are related. My therapist says she has never heard of anything like this and I've looked on a lot of websites but to no avail. Does anyone have any experience with this or any clue what it is? Is this still within the effects of an ED? Request: The new movie "To The Bone" 2017-02-06 12:20:25 reddit post I was wondering what anyone thought about the role that Lily Collins has to play in the movie "To The Bone". She had struggled with anorexia about ten years ago, but did this movie to spread awareness. However, she had to lose a bunch of weight again to play the role. I was wondering if anyone thinks this is very dangerous, as there is such a fine line between relapsing and being healthy? And what does anyone think about the movie? thanks! Request: I need help getting a healthy relationship with food 2017-02-06 12:18:12 reddit post During my entire childhood, I was heavily medicated. I have ADHD and the medicine was incredibly appetite suppressing. I was very underweight up until I was around 11. I went off my medication, and gained a lot of weight over a year from both comfort-eating and general over-eating. When I turned thirteen, I was overweight. I moved schools and began dieting. I lost weight very quickly on simple calorie restriction, which spiralled into an eating disorder. I'm underweight(slightly) as I type this, and I'm really damn tired of this. I want my life back. There's people that make me happy, and I think this is my final attempt at getting myself back together. I want to cooperate, I want to be healthy, I want to do sports, and I want to eat a scoop of ice cream without wanting to hurt myself. I'm sick of calories. I'm so fucking sick of calories.. However, binge-eating is normalized in my family. Both my parents are overweight(my dad just slightly, and my mom is morbidly obese). My mom has been weight-cycling, since she was thirteen. Every month, she'll go on a low carb, low-fat incredibly restricted diet, and about 5 weeks in, she'll break and binge eat. I suspect that she has bulimia, because I keep finding little chunks of vomit in the toilet. My dad wants me to focus on gaining weight, and I know he's doing it from a place of love, but I don't want to start shoving down large amounts of food again. He tells me that I won't be normal or 'old-me' again, before I can finish a large amount in one sitting. All I want is to be a normal girl. I understand that I'm underweight and I understand that it's unhealthy, but I just really want to focus on getting my food habits in order. TL;DR How much is a portion for a fourteen year old girl? How much veg, meat, starch etc. should be in a portion? How much candy is a normal portion? How do I stop counting calories? I know the calories of close to every food, so it's not like I can just avoid, those I can estimate. How do I make sure I'm getting in enough food without counting calories? Request: How do I regain a healthy relationship with food? 2017-01-31 16:25:23 reddit post Hi Reddit. I had a confronting conversation with my boyfriend yesterday that made me realize I have a distorted relationship with food. I have recently lost a substantial amount of weight, and I'm very close to my goal weight. I had a falling out with my boyfriend recently because the upcoming month is full of birthdays and dinners, which means a LOT of eating. I usually restrict my meals and make sure to only eat what I deem diet-appropriate and therefore this has caused me major stress. The birthdays and dinner parties are completely overshadowed by the impending doom that is eating and although I AM going to try and just join the celebrations and not stick with the low-calorie option while everyone else is ordering typical celebration food, this is already ruining my days a month in advance. I told my boyfriend I wanted to schedule some days of eating low-calorie dinners, to balance out the bad days, which he agreed to, but also acknowledged I had a lot of emotion about "having to eat bad stuff" and that I am absolutely dreading these days. He expressed his concern about my 'obsession' with food and I have to admit he is right. I really have to force myself not to stand on the scale every day (I'm most happy doing it every morning and every evening) just to keep track of my goal and go to bed feeling bad about myself if I've gained weight compared to the day before (which I rationally KNOW is not a healthy nor reliable way to measure... yet I just can't help needing that control). On one hand I think I'm doing this the right way since, on the other hand this is bringing up really strong emotions in me while I could also be like "hey, I'll enjoy myself now and will just pick my diet back up afterwards and get there, albeit somewhat later" - Rationally I know this, but there's this pressing feeling of guilt when I eat I can't get rid of. Any tips? Request: How long does it take for the esophagus to heal after BN? 2017-01-31 16:19:36 reddit post I've have BN for about 20 years on and off. (Mostly on.) The worst was when I was barfing multiple times a day for over a year. I started having some pain so I had it scoped and the doctor acted like it was a horror show. I've got lots of ulcering and scarring. I've stopped cold turkey and it's been about six months. I went back for the follow up and the doctor said it didn't look any better. I'm curious how long something like this might take to improve considering I've stopped completely. I haven't told my doctor about the BN, but I think he might suspect because he keeps saying he can't see how my throat and esophagus can look so bad just from acid reflux. So should I be seeing improvements by now? If so then what could be keeping it from healing considering I've stopped? Is the time table for something like this years rather than months? Request: Dealing with guilt 2017-01-31 16:17:46 reddit post I know I have a problem but I don't do anything about it because I'm scared of gaining weight and being fat. When I eat, I feel guilty and depressed but when I don't eat, I feel okay for a while but tell myself later on, "this is wrong" I look in the mirror and ask, "What the hell did you do to yourself?" as I see fat in places then decide to fast (That usually doesn't last long) but yeah, you get what i'm saying. it's just a cycle of that and I'm tired. How do I get over my fear of gaining weight and how do I get out of my cycle of fasting, binging and extreme guilt? Request: Could this be considered an eating disorder? 2017-01-31 00:53:10 reddit post I've been talking to a girl for the last month and she brought up her concern that I may have an eating disorder. I'm not a tall guy, I'm around 5'6. Since Christmas, I've lost a lot of weight. I used to have problems with self mutilation. I stopped cutting but wouldn't eat when I felt hungry because I felt for some reason that I deserved to feel that pain. My problem is that I don't get hungry very often but when I do, I'll typically smoke a cigarette or drink caffeine to curb the hunger. I recently figured out that I do this as a means of control. I work 40 hours a week at a job I despise so in some weird way, I feel like deciding when I eat, I have some form of control over something. Could this possibly be an eating disorder? If so, how would you describe it? Has anyone else gone through this, and if so, how did you shake it? I'd be eternally grateful for any help or advice you could offer. Request: Health Insurance and Eating Disorders 2017-01-31 00:11:59 reddit post Hello! I have a request. So my wife has completed in patient therapy and is recovering very well and I am so happy and proud of her. She is sticking to her meal plans, sticking to therapy and requests from her nutritionist. Currently, we have been paying for all of our services out of pocket and it is really starting to take a toll. (Was an independent contractor for a while.) But recently I have received a new job and will have health insurance provided. And I really really want to keep my wife on the right path. My question in general: Does Health Insurance cover ED therapy? Or is this different between Health insurance providers? And to go deeper, what do I sign up for? Do HMO's cover mental health therapy? Should I go with a PPO? Etc. Etc. Anybody with any experience in the matter would be very helpful. Thank you very much!!! Request: Do I have it? 2017-01-29 21:08:24 reddit post So I've been thinking and I wonder if I have an eating disorder or not. I might go a whole day sometime without me eating. And I always think it is Because I am lazy. But sometimes I think to myself you are getting bigger maybe I should skip lunch? That's what one part of me thinks, but the other one is thinking. What are you doing? Don't starve yourself you are better than this. So maybe I don't have an eating disorder. Maybe I am just bad at eating. I really don't know. Request: My wife needs inpatient treatment 2017-01-29 21:02:58 reddit post I [31 M] need help. My wife [28 F] has BN, and it has gotten much worse over the past few years. She ended up in an inpatient facility a few years ago but had to leave early due to insurance reasons. Now the ED is worse than ever. She needs inpatient treatment. The problem is we are broke, she's in grad school, I work full time and take night classes twice a week, and we have a young son. We can't afford the treatment, can't afford the additional child care, and really can't stop school, I know we actually can, but we both ended up squandering early education attempts and need to lift ourselves out of this rut. What can we do? I've tried to help as much as I can but I'm just a guy with no experience or qualifications to help her, I'm as supportive as I can be. She now ends up binging and purging late at night and then needing to sleep all morning, has developed an ulcer that periodically puts her out of commission. She had me put a lock on the cupboard that has trigger foods along with her wallet and keys, but if I forget it gets raided. Food we buy disappears, and it is costly. I just feel lost, I basically know in order for her to have a chance of recovery she needs to go somewhere, but it would be devastating to our already terrible finances and life prospects. She has tried almost everything, we're not new to recovery attempts, information, strategies, and the like. We are at a loss and I'm begging for something. Does anyone have any advice on how to get her the help she needs? Request: How do I convince myself to eat more? 2017-01-29 21:01:27 reddit post I'm recovering from anorexia and am at a point where my calories are up but I'm over exercising as a way of coping with my anxiety. As a result, I need to eat more, because I'm still losing and need to gain. But it's a lot harder/stressful than I thought it was going to be and I keep trying to talk myself out of it. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get over this hurdle Request: Advice on managing anxiety, exercise and ED 2017-01-29 21:00:12 reddit post Hi! I'm about 3 years into recovery, and its generally been really successful. However, recently a load of anxiety has flared up completely seperately to ED stuff - triggered by general worries aboot graduating college and what to do with adulthood etc etc. To help combat the anxiety I've been advised to exercise more and it does seem to be helping BUT I can feel myself slipping back into old habits of control and perfectionism. Basically, how do you manage to deal with seperate issues, which need different treatments, without negatively impacting everything? Thanks x Request: How to handle intrusive thoughts during recovery? 2017-01-28 02:30:04 reddit post Hi, I am recovering from a restrictive ED and I feel like I could eat a mountain. My dietitian says it's my brain basically rebeling against all my past restrictions and craving all the delicious foods it had to live so long without. Thus, in an exceptionally "brave" moment, I called a friend and asked her to meet for a pizza dinner next Friday. She said yeah, why not? But right now I feel horrible. That voice inside me is screaming "how could you? You're such an idiot! Pizza is gonna make you obese and you should totally cancel the dinner! Why are you such a fat pig? Why can't you eat like a normal person?". I was actually thinking about calling my friend on Friday afternoon and telling her that I'm sick or something like that. How should I handle this kind of thoughts? I know it's just my ED refusing to go away, but it's scary and I can't completely think rationally.

Request: I need some advice.. 2017-01-21 12:12:26 reddit post I'm a 20 year old guy, which admittedly already makes me feel alienated from all this. 99% of things related to EDs is geared towards women. I guess I feel a little invalid? I dunno. Anyway, I've always felt guilty for eating and starved myself on occasion out of self hatred. I worry constantly about my weight and appearance and no matter how much I hear otherwise I feel fat and ugly. I literally feel like the ugliest person on earth Recently I started dieting and working out every day. I've been severely restricting the calories I eat every day, and the lower I get the number the better I feel. I threw out my back and I kept working out because I want to be skinny so badly. In the past week I've lost 12 pounds The thing is, I feel like...I'm overweight, and feel so fat that this is what I deserve. I don't deserve to eat. I have to hurry up and slim down if I ever wanna have any value or have others not be disgusted by me. I don't care about my health, I just want to not hate my appearance anymore Logically I know this isn't healthy. I recognize this is becoming a problem. But I feel like I don't "count" as having a real problem because I don't eat even fewer calories and because im a guy. Like if I truly had an eating disorder I would be skinnier and eating even fewer calories a day This is the first I've really opened up about this, and I guess... I just really would like to hear from some people who understand and get advice on what to do.

Request: My Girlfriend [19] wants to quit treatment 2017-01-20 14:29:59 reddit post Hello i desperately need your advice! **Prologue:** When I met my girlfriend, about a year ago, she was fresh out of treatment center. She was doing great and we had an awesome relationship throughout the summer. However when she went away to college (4 hours from home) her Anorexia completely took over. Long story short she was hospitalized for few weeks in November(extremely underweight). **Main:** She has been in Monte Nido Rainrock for past month. Unfortunately she is not doing very well. She is extremely homesick(her family and I live on the opposite coast so visiting is not much of an option), she claims that she hates it there, that they don't help her, that they make her fat, and that she is ready for the next step. I understand that this is typical ED behavior, however today she signed papers so that she can discharge herself in two weeks. She says that she is going to continue treatment outside the treatment center. The main problem is that her mother, a doctor, has been dealing with her anorexia for past 4 years and at this point she refuses to take her home unless she completes treatment. My girlfriend says that she will discharge anyways and will go to shelter. I'm not completely sure if she's bluffing or if she'll actually do it. Today she asked me if she can live at my house for a while. I said that she can but only if clinical director confirms that she's medically stable and is ready for the next step. **Question:** I know for a fact that she's discharging against medical advice. Do you think she Is actually ready to discharge, or is it ED talking? Should I keep convincing her to stay? And if yes, then how can I motivate her to stay in treatment center? I love her, and to be honest I am worried that she will build resentment towards me if i keep convincing her to stay there. Thank you. Request: I [17m]need advice on how to help my friend [16f]with her eating disorder and where to find her professional help. 2017-01-18 10:59:59 reddit post Thanks to anyone who answers in advance, and sorry for my english as it's not my first language. Today my girl-friend bought pills to stop her hunger, in order to get thinner. It broke my heart. She is clearly not overweight and she already told me before about how she keeps counting calories in her head, throwing up after some meals, etc. She is clearly struggling with an eating disorder. After talking to her on the phone for a while she agreed to show up if I come with her to a doctor's appointment, or a psychiatrist or whatever she needs. She has a difficult relationship with her parents and so do I, so she's only going to work with me if we keep it a secret from them, she's ashamed of her problem. Since I am the only one she tells this to, I feel obligated to find her help and do something with this, as I've lost a friend to anorexia when I was younger and it's not going to happen again. What can I do to help her with this? Where do I find professional help? I feel obligated to find her help but I am overwhelmed by this task since I have no idea where to start. We live in The Netherlands. Thanks reddit! 3 Request: Is it possible to go back to eating intuitively after a restrictive ED? 2017-01-18 10:54:51 reddit post I used to have a certain weight that I was naturally able to maintain without ever counting calories and feeling excessive hunger or fullness. Now that I am recovering from a restrictive ED I am truly afraid that I have definitively f*cked up my "natural regulation system" and that I'll need to count calories and just be really careful in order not to gain weight fast, because my body won't ever be able to regulate anymore and find its balance like it used to. It's a fact that, right now, if I had to follow my hunger cues I would eat just about everything and gain weight. Do you have any relevant experience on the matter? Request: How to handle the stress of school and social anxiety without relapsing?? 2017-01-11 03:32:32 reddit post Hi. I'm a freshman in college, recovering from AN-b/p. My first semester did not go very well...the stress from a heavier workload was rough on me. I also have social anxiety, and I kept myself isolated out of terror, resulting in the fact that I currently have zero friends at school. I want desperately to connect with people, but the loneliness makes me so depressed, and all I want to do is make myself numb to cope. So I spiralled back into the cycle of restricting, bingeing, and purging. Over winter break, I've managed to pull myself out of it and I've been doing significantly better. But school starts again next week and I am so scared that I will spiral again once I go back to the stress and the loneliness and isolation. My anxiety over this is increasing daily, to the point where I've been unable to sleep the past few nights. My eating is getting more erratic with the stress and I spent the morning scouring my parents' house for laxatives in a fit of desperation. I feel helpless in the face of my disorder, and I feel like relapse is just inevitable at this point and I will never be able to make anything of myself or handle the pressures of the real world. I'm sorry for the rant--I just really need some support, advice, virtual hugs, anything really. Thank you so much. Request: How do i get myself back out of this mess? 2017-01-11 03:30:52 reddit post Hi, so i have an eating disorder that is mostly under control. I don't really know if the eating disorder is linked to my depression or that it's something on its own. I've never been overweight, but i've always been a bit too preoccupied about my weight (loads to do with my family and upbringing). I got depressed for the first time during my teen years and when i'm depressed i hardly eat because it takes a lot of energy and i don't feel hungry or forget. Between my episodes i've gained a bit of weight but, not excessive and i was feeling a lot better for almost three years. Now i've been struggling a bit again on and off for a year, but i'm getting better at recognizing the signs of me falling into depression so i've not hit rock bottom. Now, i've had a very good past four-fiveish months. I'm spending a lot of time with friend, going out, traveling, sleeping good (so not feeling tired all the time), etc. so i've gained weight. More than i've ever had. So for about a month i've been struggling a lot with my self-esteem (plus i hate the holiday-period because it makes me kind of sad). I've tried working out more (i used to go to track field class twice a week when i was still studying), i'm eating healthier, etc. but its been difficult since i'm not often eating/drinking alone like i used to. My friend will think i'm stupid for focusing on this much. They know that i'm trying to eat healthier, but watching everything i eat will be weird for them. Now, with new years parties i've come into contact with cocaine again, with which i don't have the best history either. I've had the "grand" idea last week to buy some cocaine to help me not wanting to eat. So i've realized this is just all kinds of fucked up. I've got myself out of that drug-dependency before so that not the biggest issue. It's mostly that i don't want my drug-problem affecting my problems with body image, or them being intertwined. Does anybody have a similar story or somebody that can relate to this? I think i mostly want to talk about it and maybe get some extra tips to get me "started" again. Thank you. Unheard of ED - Intermittently selective but not picky 2017-01-10 17:40:10 reddit post I am concerned about a friend who's 23. She's had this strange disorder since high school and wasn't always picky. Here are some details: * She's not very picky. * She feels extremely sick when thinking about eating certain foods intermittently. (For example: She likes food X. If she's not in the mood for food X, and she tries to eat it, she feels like throwing up) * If she eats the same thing daily, that food will begin to repulse her very quickly. * Certain bland foods leave an awful aftertaste. * It all depends on what her body wants. * Water can have this effect as well. * She has to eat frequently to avoid "hunger headaches". * Sometimes all food can be repulsive to her, so she has to choke down a vitamin boost shake. (The kind they give to cancer patients) Is this weird, or has anyone seen this before? Doctors haven't been able to diagnose her problem. Request: I think I have an eating disorder but I'm not sure! 2017-01-10 00:20:03 reddit post For the past ~1.5 years I've had issues with eating. I would get stressed and binge eat (usually candy) to the point that it made me feel sick, and sometimes to the point of physically vomiting. This has progressed to the point where I will overeat at meals, and then vomit afterwards. I don't even feel any nausea anymore, I don't MAKE myself vomit, I just sort of calmly walk into the bathroom, sit in front of the toilet, and vomit. No retching, no contracting of the stomach muscles, nothing like that, the food just comes up. And it doesn't really feel like when I have the flu, it doesn't taste acidic at all and I don't feel sick afterwards. I'm trying to not overeat, but I sort of feel like if I eat ANYTHING lately, I have the urge to vomit afterwards. The weird thing is that I can control it too, like if I am out at a restaurant I might gag a little after eating, but not really noticeably (or at least I hide it from people), but I can wait like 30 minutes or however long it takes to get home before I vomit. It's like I don't even need to vomit but then as soon as I get to the bathroom I'll realize, okay I can vomit now, and I just do it. It's more like using the washroom than it is like vomiting, I can hold it for a while if I'm out in public or whatever. I don't really know if this makes sense or what. Objectively I'm not overweight but I have gained a lot of weight over the past few years so I do feel fat, and because of that I'm not really STOPPING myself from vomiting, and honestly I'm not really sure if I could if I tried to. I'm just confused because I'm not sick, and I'm not forcing myself to vomit, but I do vomit after every meal. Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Does anyone have advice for me? Sorry if this is confusing, I'm really confused about it myself to be honest. Request : Anybody knows how to deal with constant hunger? 2017-01-10 00:17:06 reddit post I've decided to be healthy and logged my food. It's been about 2 months and I constantly been overthinking about food. I can't think of anything else. Every time I go to school or work, or even just on my way, I think of food. I thought it was just because I wanted to eat for fun and I am just planning everything else but I feel like it is becoming very unhealthy to constantly eat. I don't eat unhealthy, however, I think it's unhealthy to eat like every 30 minutes a full meal. I can't afford therapy or anything. I've tried diet pills but I'm replacing it with green tea but I still binge on almost anything on my hands Request: Coping with medically-required weight gain on your own. 2017-01-10 00:16:14 reddit post I am currently trying to recover from anorexia binge/purge subtype. One of my main goals is to gain back enough weight to menstruate again. Every time I eat anything over my BMR, my body dysmorphia and anxiety shoots through the roof. My legs feel like stretched sausage casings and my stomach seems to dig into my waistband. I know its impossible, but the sensation of my body bloating up is completely overwhelming. I keep attempting meals and purging them in a panic later. Plus, the urge to self-harm is pounding in my head. On a deeper level, I am terrified of losing the battle with food due to my experience with binging and weight gain from EDNOS. The sensation of actually gaining and outgrowing my clothes was so distressing that I felt suicidal at times. Id equate it to a PTSD-like sensation (not to minimize true PTSD, but it was a severely painful time). I am also not weighing myself, which further contributes to this feeling of being out of control. Any experience or advice? Request: I have a problem with eating and weight 2017-01-10 00:15:21 reddit post I am a 20yo male. I am underweight. I know it. I don't wish to be "skinny". Firstly, I am never hungry. I don't get hungry - I eat and don't feel anything besides from getting to the point which I can't eat anymore. Secondly, said point is reached extremely quickly, such that I am never eating much when I do eat. I simply can't eat past that point. I eat around twice a day. Lastly, while I am eating, the food feels physically strange going down my throat - I am constantly focusing on it. Occasionally, and on every couple of (small) bites, I feel like I am about to vomit or gag. Then I have to stop eating for a long time. Every few bites. I rarely (monthly or greater) vomit - but I always feel as if I am on the verge of it. I hate this. What can I do? Request: why should I get better? 2017-01-10 00:14:28 reddit post I struggled with anorexia nervosa for a few years and I was able to regain the weight with the help of treatment. I still lack a healthy relationship with food and cannot find the motivation to try to get better. I am reaching out now because although I have been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a few years, I, with the help of someone who I want to develop a genuine and loving relationship with, have realized that I do not want to get better. Aside from this person being a motivation, I cannot get myself to try fear foods. Food is such a significant part of our lives, especially in my culture, and I know I don't want to be obsessed with nutrition labels forever and I want to enjoy the people and experiences in my life without obsessing over food and exercise. I will be participating in an intensive outpatient program very soon and I feel that I am doing all the "right" things to get better but, deep down inside, I don't think I want to change my obsessive behaviors. How do I find motivation to get better? Why should I continue with treatment? My family has adapted to my behaviors but the guy I really like acknowledged that this isn't normal. His heart is truly in the right place and I appreciate his concern and his support in getting better but, as he said, he can't want this more than I want it. Request: I can't stop eating 2017-01-10 00:13:28 reddit post I tend to eat because of stress or boredom, but even when I'm eating normal things like a meal, I feel absolutely sick after I'm done. I feel like I'm full and fat and am going to break out. However, none of this deters me, and I find myself overeating quite often. I even find that if I make an effort to not snack, it comes back twice (ex. I decide to have a smaller lunch, so I eat 10 granola bars before a huge unhealthy dinner to compensate) How do I stop doing this? Any ideas on how to control my mindset when thinking about food? I'm a female at a pretty healthy/low weight. Request: how to tell between BED and "normal" overeating post-restriction? 2017-01-06 12:01:58 reddit post Hi guys, I am unhealthily underweight and since mid-December I'm trying to recover. During Christmas I gained a bit by massively overeating. Today I weighed myself again and I discovered I had not gained weight in the last week, so I decided I was "free" to eat whatever I want - since my house is now full of all sorts of unhealthy but ridiculously delicious sweets and candies I basically ate during breakfast more than what I ate all yesterday, and most of it was sugars and saturated fats. I don't know if it qualifies as "binging", since it didn't happen compulsively and in solitude. I just sat there, in front of everyone, and ate and ate and ate. Now I feel ashamed and scared. I'm already seeing a therapist for my problem and will soon also meet a dietitian, but what I'd like to know is: what is binge-eating and what is my starving body just desperately trying to ingest more calories? I'm terrified of falling from borderline anorexia into a full-blown BED. Thank you in advance for any reply!

It hasn't got the smartest writing, but the actors play well off one another, and there are some good comedy visuals (the vomit scene had me laughing out loud). Interested to see where this show goes!
subject8986 2017-05-11 00:54:34 reddit post Wow, thanks! Really interesting regarding not needing coconut water. I think you're right, it probably would be too much work than I'm willing to do.

If youre bringing them to work, it'll defrost by lunch time. 2017-03-04 22:39:41 reddit post My fiance, who has major depression, gets botox in that same region to help with migraines. Curious if its linked. 2017-03-03 18:15:42 reddit post It sounds like those people are already depressed, but use work as a distraction. In that case, the problem isn't the lack of work. 2017-03-03 08:02:20 reddit post Since you're going for Japanese flavors, have you considered trying rice bran? It's a type of tsukemono called nukazuke. I've personally never done it, but love when my grandma does! 2017-02-25 21:25:48 reddit post Yeah... hormonal disregulation shouldn't make someone need to have sex with people other than their partner, unless that partner is asexual, or has a much lower sexual appetite (which OP didn't mention either). Let's say a woman has higher testosterone levels leading to a higher sex drive... being poly can help it for some people in relationships with unequal sex drives but it certainly is not a "medical necessity". 2017-02-25 19:41:10 reddit post What I got done when I had braces was that I got the other lateral incisor pulled, and then with braces, my canines were moved towards my front teeth. Then, my canines were sanded to look like incisors. They're a little 'rounder' than regular lateral incisors but they are symmetrical. The roundness could be fixed with veneers but nah. 2017-02-25 05:16:47 reddit post Dang, your sourdough starter got a SCOBY? That's pretty wild 2017-02-25 04:02:47 reddit post I'm reading that now. It just seemed like a coincidence since I just started making kombucha and this hasn't happened before. I have a current batch of kombucha going with unfiltered apple juice, I wonder if that could do anything? I also had an idea of filling the rest of my ACV bottle with leftover apple juice... would I get more ACV? I dont know anything about making vinegar. Funny thing happened: my store-bought apple cider vinegar grew a pellicle. Could that have happened from the yeast in the air from my kombucha batch? 2017-02-25 03:26:19 reddit post 2017-02-24 20:29:49 reddit post Add silken tofu instead of soy milk 2017-02-24 00:48:32 reddit post The carbonation should happen in the 2nd ferment. It shouldnt be very fizzy at all after the 1st ferment. For me, in the winter I've been doing 2 weeks for the 1st ferment and a week for the 2nd ferment. In a tropical climate, you could probably do half the time. You need to move it to air-tight containers to fizz. 2017-02-14 09:02:16 reddit post I get this too. I have to keep reminding myself that treatments cost more. Also, I tell myself that I deserve yummy foods. 2017-02-02 19:07:17 reddit post You don't have to add it to your resume. I haven't started my masters yet, but I doubt I'll add the fact that I was a grocery store cashier in my undergrad years when I try to find work. Especially if you have related volunteer work and fieldwork that is more relevant. 2017-01-23 05:47:10 reddit post Love using jackfruit like this. I'll make it simple on myself and just add in BBQ sauce. So good! Has anyone made nata de coco? How different is the process to making kombucha? 2017-01-12 06:16:02 reddit post Out of curiosity, I tasted a pellicle and it reminded me a lot like Nata de Coco. It's a popular dessert / dessert topping in asian cultures. When I wanted to try to make it in the past, the recipes I saw had a bunch of ingredients I didn't have so I kind of gave up on it (I didn't try that hard). After familiarizing myself with making kombucha, it seems like the process is super similar. I was thinking of experimenting with throwing in a pellicle in some coconut water + water + some kombucha starter liquid. I'm curious if would work... or is that just how it's originally made anyway? Or should I just rinse and sweeten a pellicle? I just started making kombucha so I don't have tons to experiment with (yet). 2017-01-12 05:47:58 reddit post Taste it once or twice a day. It'll get more sour as time passes. You can also look into making sauerkraut, which doesnt have a starter at all, it's just cabbage and salt. I've used a probiotic capsule trying to make cashew yogurt and it was pretty good (blended cashews + water, and added the capsule). 2016-12-29 00:36:56 reddit post Try [blending beans](http://bitesizevegan.com/vegan-health/the-ultimate-vegan-muscle-gainer-shake-bodybuilder-derek-tresize/) instead! 2016-12-04 04:31:28 reddit post You could use it in place of peanut butter to make a 'peanut sauce'. Easy way would be almond butter, sriracha, lime, soy sauce. 2016-11-28 21:44:42 reddit post Recently did this but with leftover rice and mushroom gravy. It's what I had but apparently they do this in Creole/Cajun cuisine. 2016-11-25 19:20:25 reddit post I use groupon when I already know what I'm looking to buy, and check groupon to see if theres any deals. For instance, I'm going out to eat with my parents and look for deals nearby, and see a restaurant I've been wanting to eat at. So I'll purchase it at the restaurant on my phone. 2016-11-24 19:40:39 reddit post Thanks! Super awesome that your dinner was pretty much vegan! I've never heard of fried apple peels... That sounds yummy. I'm making mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy (from Hot for Food), a mushroom walnut loaf, and banana cream pie (from Minimalist Baker). It's potluck style so my fiance's mom is bringing cranberry sauce and a waldorf salad, and my mom is making a tofu salad and some sort of kabocha pumpkin dish (she's Japanese). 2016-11-24 19:33:11 reddit post I figured trolls want downvotes, so I gave them an upvote. Definitely not clever. 2016-11-24 18:23:33 reddit post Upvoted because you didn't even try. Our thanksgiving meal will be fully vegan! 2016-11-24 17:23:02 reddit post Just bragging and also very excited. Ive been vegan for a year and a half, I veganized my fiance and just recently veganized his mom. The other guests are my parents who aren't vegan, but since it's a vegan majority, the entire dinner is vegan. Small but ethical dinner and Christmas might look very similar (but with more guests)! I ended up saying, 'if you want turkey, you can bring your own portions' but laziness is making them not. So, yay for also having it non-forced (sort of). 2016-11-12 00:31:38 reddit post Unless I'm understanding it wrong, seitan/wheat protein is less bioavailable than soy products so I would suggest buying some TVP (Bob's Red Mill TVP runs like $2.50 per bag). I usually just dump some TVP with my tomato sauce when I make pasta, quite easy to prepare. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_value#Typical_values) 2016-11-06 01:59:39 reddit post By having power, I mean more along the lines of society puts power into one role over the other. So, it could be teacher-student, police-prisoner, stronger-weaker, older-younger, richer-poorer, etc etc. Of course it isn't 100%, and the opposite abuse can exist, it still generally is seen along that line and people will often blame the victim for acting out (ie people blaming the BLM movement when police brutality was the original violence). Another way to see it, and I just read this today so I'm no expert, was something I saw on /r/raisedbynarcissists where there's the idea of 'catching fleas', based on the idea of how if you lie with wolves, you'll catch fleas. But, the victim will still not be narcissists, but only pick up on behavior that they were around. My thinking is that the Jasper/Lapis dynamic is following that idea, especially since Jasper is physically stronger for the most part, and that Jasper seems to have abusive behavior towards everyone around her. Lapis has picked up on abusive behavior by what has happened to her (trapping, because she was also trapped by force). But, these are fictional characters, and maybe there is no difference between 'fleas' and a personality disorder. Maybe Jasper was abused in her past, and she 'caught fleas'. edit: wow because i am getting downvotes, here's some reading for you all.

When I went vegan, I saw people who thrived on high carb diets and was relieved to eat this way because carbs are tasty and I feel great. From what I understand, our bodies preferred source of energy is glucose, so it takes more energy to convert fats/proteins into usable energy. 2016-10-28 19:56:41 reddit post Pita bread with hummus and carrots/cucumber sticks, or cherry tomatoes. I cut the pita into 1/4 and dip. Easy and yum. Also, I make a homemade trail mix, such as sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, dates, whatever. Date/coconut/peanut rolls are good too. Just blend in a food processor and make into balls. Theres variations online for different amounts. I keep editing this because this is like my favorite topic lol. Another one I like is getting a tortilla, spread peanut butter on, and put a banana in the middle. Roll it up, cut into halves or fourths. Kind of like a pbj. 2016-10-15 02:55:28 reddit post How much did you take for it to end up doing as much damage? I'm pretty good at limiting my intake. 2016-10-15 02:00:14 reddit post I feel like I've lost myself so even basic advice feels really nice right now. It's hard to piece things together. Thanks. 2016-10-15 01:45:02 reddit post Thank you, that helps a lot. Is it just a waiting game? I do have access to klonopin, xanax, propanalol, and high-CBD pot. I don't know if I should take anything or if it'll make it worse. I took a tiny bit of klonopin last night but just fell asleep so I dont remember if I felt any better. just started feeling it a few days ago. what am i supposed to do? 2016-10-15 00:34:30 reddit post This is not my first time feeling dpdr, but before, it seemed to be like a panic attack (severe dpdr but only lasted a few hours), or perhaps related to depression, where it was pretty mild. A couple of days ago, I smoked a half bowl of pot, nothing unlike me (although I've been smoking more the past month because I got my MMJ card). During the high, I felt the change, but I was still euphoric so it was okay. But now the DPDR hasn't left. It's a constant feeling with no break. No fucking break. It's like I'm sliding down a slide with no end in sight. I just want it to stop. I'm also going through SSRI withdrawal (very slowly) because I just want to know what my body is like. I have trauma with a previous psychiatrist overprescribing me medications and I just don't know what's necessary anymore. I've also heard that hormones can cause dpdr and my cycle is out of wack. I can't tell if I'm ovulating (I'm tracking using the FAM out of curiosity). I don't know if this is relevant. I'm just so sick and tired of seeing doctors. Should I just wait this out? How long? I'm uncomfortable because I just want this to stop. At least with a panic attack, I'm okay within a few hours or the next day. If I saw anyone, who would it be? Gyno to check for hormones? Psychiatrist (I'd have to find a new one anyway at this point, which is such a headache). Am I supposed to stop going to work or school? It feels like I'm sick. I can't remember what happened the second before. I forget the begining of my sentence by the time I finish the sentence. It's hard. Socializing feels so awkward. Am I supposed to stop going to school and work once I fuck up badly? I just feel so confused and I don't know what to do. 2016-09-14 20:36:58 reddit post I ended up going with this brand, but the 'betsey lou'. Thanks! 2016-09-09 18:54:51 reddit post I was propogating some larger leaves and I got mold that looked like this on the soil under the leaves. I just moved my leaves and everything is fine. 2016-08-20 17:47:37 reddit post Those look great. Do you know if theyre comparable to Toms? Just looking at the price and they look similar, but more expensive. 2016-08-20 17:45:07 reddit post I emailed softstarshoes... They have kids vegan shoes, which is funny because it's usually the adults that are vegan. Thanks. 2016-08-20 03:47:29 reddit post Possibly, my biggest concern with slippers is that theyre full of cushioning so I thought this would be a good sub. I'll head over there, thanks. Minimalist house shoes/slippers? 2016-08-20 01:32:39 reddit post I know this is barefoot running and this question is neither about being barefoot or athletics. BUT I work as a receptionist at a Japanese wellness center and wear slippers while working. I would be barefoot if I could, as I do at home. I've been searching and can't find a minimalist slipper that would work for my needs. Other things: I'm vegan, so things like soft-soled moccasins are difficult to find without using leather. Would prefer them to be on the cheaper side. Should look somewhat professional. Thanks! xPS 13 or wait for zenbook 3? 2016-07-26 04:33:39 reddit post * **Total budget and country of purchase:** $700-1000, but the lower end is definitely preferred. USA. * **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** Best specs. * **How important is weight to you?** Pretty important. * **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.** Windows or mac (moving from a macbook pro early 2011). * **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** Smaller is preferred, for lightness and cost. * **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** Light gaming, light photoshop, have done CAD and video editing but most likely wont in the future. * **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Probably the sims 4 haha. Not sensitive to FPS, willing to game low res. Honestly I'm used to not gaming because of my current macbook so I'm not sure. * **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Not looking into touch screen/2-in-1. Looking for good design and aesthetics. If available in a lighter color or white is preferred. I have a nexus 5x so usb type c charging appeals to me. Zenbook 3's fingerprint reader appeals to me but not necessary. SSD highly preferred. * **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** I keep getting the thought in my head of, "if I only spend $100 more I can get this...!" but I also am low on funds in life so it would be smart of me to spend less. Aesthetics are important to me, and when I went to the Microsoft store, the XPS 13 stood out to me next to a current Zenbook. But, the Zenbook 3 looks amazing and would probably be around the same price if I got a XPS13 Skylake + harddrive upgrade (~$1000). I'm definitely still considering a certified refurbished XPS13 Broadwell ($650). I don't know the difference in speed, and I'm not sure I need higher power. Every rec I see is to get Skylake, though. 2016-07-11 21:33:35 reddit post I don't know if it's internal or external damage. The place we got was a fixer upper. Is a shoe necessary? I don't think we have that on the baseboard. 2016-07-11 03:30:13 reddit post I just started doing this, too. I also have a yoga mat to do yoga in. 2016-07-11 02:50:09 reddit post I'm repainting my bathroom and noticed some of the baseboard is detached from the wall, as well as some minor water damage. I'm low on budget so I'm repairing instead of replacing the baseboard. Should I just nail the baseboard into the wall with finishing nails, use caulk, both, or something else? 2016-04-12 02:53:09 reddit post Depends on the traits. It could easy feel like my partner was fetishizing me and only liking me for the idea of a partner as opposed to the whole picture. I'm half asian and if my partner claimed they had "yellow fever" I would run away as fast as I could. 2016-03-13 23:51:02 reddit post Have you looked into Herbivore Clothing? They have a [similar design](http://www.herbivoreclothing.com/good-luck-elephant-racerback-tank-top/) to your description. 2016-03-07 00:04:53 reddit post Check out /r/littlespace if you haven't. That feeling is common enough. 2016-03-03 22:55:01 reddit post as another scar-owner, damn. that's good. definitely looking into Andrea's work now. 2016-02-21 00:05:33 reddit post Yes, it's the same reason I strongly believe in birth control education for humans, so we don't have such a high population density that fucks up the quality of living for so many living beings. "Raised humanely" is quite bs too. If someone were to say they would promise to "raise me humanely" as long as I was killed prematurely for them to eat, I'd tell them to go fuck themselves. 2016-02-05 02:47:59 reddit post Look for Vital Wheat Gluten. You just mix it with water and knead it a little bit. Or, even simpler ingredients if you can't find it, you can actually just knead dough (flour + water) and rinse it under water to rinse the starch away. But that's way more time intensive. They should have vital wheat gluten at health stores like Whole Foods, or look online. 2016-02-01 19:54:31 reddit post Got back to the gym yesterday even though I haven't gone in maybe 9 months! I have been doing yoga, and as fun as that has been, it's only one class twice a week so I can't expect to make any significant improvements. Went to the gym yesterday with a friend, told him I was nervous right before a deadlift, and had some girls overhear saying "You can do it!" and it made me smile. What sweet girls! I get nervous because I've injured my back (herniated disk, probably due to some hypermobility I have) and I feel like I'll injure it again. But, I didn't injure myself yesterday and feel a nice soreness today! 2016-02-01 01:08:04 reddit post Think of it as decor instead of just storage. Think of a theme, for instance [this person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcfAlyX9hTY) liked the idea of her place looking boutique-ish. 2016-01-24 04:21:11 reddit post If you properly flour the pin, it probably shouldn't stick. I don't usually get dough stuck to regular rolling pins. If it does, I'd just use a brush instead of a sponge and it should come off, and to wash it right away so it doesn't crust. 2016-01-21 09:27:39 reddit post Wool can be stolen skin. Look up mulesing, happens often. 2016-01-19 08:49:25 reddit post Okcupid definitely helps. I end up being a little bit more comfortable with the person, and i also know that they think I'm attractive. I also don't have as much anxiety with one on one interactions as I do with large groups of people, or meeting new people. I've been with my fianc for over 6 years now and I feel very comfortable with him, kind of like a surrogate parent with me being the child who has separation anxiety. Which is funny, because I temporarily moved so we're long distance at the moment. 2016-01-16 22:51:26 reddit post It's a little more complicated than that. Shelters don't reject any animals that come in, so that's why they have space issues in the first place. Rescues take out the adoptable (cute, young, etc) animals when they have space. Good shelters (with lots of volunteers that allows socialization) will only euthanize because of severe illness or aggression problems. But, they're the ones that will have the less adoptable animals that are perfectly friendly (black cats, pits, chihuahuas, old animals, etc). But, if someone is set on a specific breed, rescues make it easier. Way better option than going to a breeder. 2016-01-07 08:41:59 reddit post Another way it may get be thicker is using a high speed blender. I've only made almond milk in a blendtec and it was super creamy. I imagine if I made it in my oster it would be quite watery because of the less surface area of the almonds. 2015-12-28 23:12:07 reddit post My go-to is pasta (fusilli) with marinara and TVP and frozen mixed veggies. 2015-12-24 19:22:13 reddit post A box of Vegan Cuts snacks, or a shirt from Compassion Co or Herbivore Clothing! 2015-12-22 22:42:57 reddit post Have you looked at CSA boxes near your area? 2015-12-16 09:10:32 reddit post What about the nuvaring? I took it for a while and it never came out of my body, and you're also allowed to take it out of your body for (I think) 4 hours or so before anything happens. So, you can take it out during sex if you want. You have it in for 3 weeks and out for 1. 2015-12-15 09:22:55 reddit post I was honestly expecting an "elbows too pointy" somewhere in u/yangying's rant. 2015-12-15 07:39:49 reddit post I'm imagining it with a chocolate sauce (for "soy sauce") and maybe a cashew-matcha cream "wasabi". Maybe it'll look too similar and confuse expectations too much though. 2015-12-14 03:40:06 reddit post I know you're joking around but you're pointing out an important thing. People can call themselves whatever they want if it's a part of their identity, because they're reclaiming words- like when black people say "nigga", but a white person can't, or a lesbian can call herself a dyke, but a random person on the street calling her a dyke is offensive. Some disabled people also call themselves crips, etc. Someone who is half black and half white can call themselves mulatto if they believe the way they are using it will give power away from the offensive meaning. A white person shouldn't make the decision if they can use the word or not because it isn't a part of their identity, so it doesn't affect them in the same way the half black, half white person would experience the word. This is, of course, a controversial topic and everyone has differing opinions. It isn't a black-and-white (heh) issue, so we can't say what will be the 100% right or wrong way of going about it. What works for some people might not work for others. It's just important to respect others, and if someone tells you what you said was disrespectful, listen to them and apologize. If someone from a marginalized identity says it's okay for you to use a certain word, don't be certain that that's the belief of everyone in that group. 2015-12-13 21:51:44 reddit post Not related to kombucha, but my fianc just had a similar experience of an instant itchiness after drinking some coffee, and it happened multiple times with the same bag of coffee grounds. I think it was a bad batch or something, as we never figured it out, but he's fine with every other coffee. 2015-12-12 23:50:22 reddit post It's so unfortunate. I want Bernie in office, but Hillary seems to be the most likely candidate and I'll have to vote for her just to avoid a Republican getting in. Non-participation/voter apathy in the youth demographic is basically a vote for Republicans. 2015-12-12 23:29:33 reddit post Along with Happy Cow, I've also found an app on the iphone that translates what we can't eat in many different languages. It's called "V-Cards". I haven't used it yet but it seems helpful. Of course, you can google "Vegan + (city name)". I also heard a tip that you might want to focus on the experience of travel (socially, educationally, inspirationally, or whatever else) and not focus on traveling for food. You can also consider traveling to places that can be paired with veganism, such as volunteering at animal sanctuaries (like elephant sanctuaries in Thailand, etc)! 2015-12-12 22:46:17 reddit post For those saying that it might go bad soon-- probably. Freeze what you can and eat what you can't. Freeze herbs in oil in ice cube trays, freeze other things on a tray before putting in a bag so they're easier to separate. Make stews, and freeze that. Look up what you should be blanching before freezing, too (usually greens, I think). Look up recipes that work well with frozen veggies that might get mushy-- for example, I just made an alfredo sauce that's based on blended up cauliflower. I personally probably wouldn't want steamed frozen cauliflower, but if it's blended up, you can't tell. With the rest, unless you have a large family, make meals for friends and they might repay you with a meal in the future. 2015-12-12 22:30:31 reddit post Funny enough- I ate more Italian (or, Italian-American?) food after going vegan! I find it very easy to make vegan- pastas, olive oil, marinara sauce, pesto, eggplant-based things, gnocchi, rustic breads, etc etc I'd also like to mention that it's not a horrible decision to eat vegan all year, and then eat what your family serves on holidays. I personally wouldn't do it, but my fiance does. I think "meatless mondays" are a great thing, and so is being a "flexitarian" (as a stepping stone to veganism). I think a good goal right now is to spread the idea that veganism is the best choice on an ethical level, because society isn't even there yet (even though it seems obvious!) 2015-12-11 22:53:02 reddit post Reminds me of when I went to a banquet for my school, and I think I was one of the only vegans. But they had the spaghetti with marinara as the vegan option, and I kept hearing a girl saying "the vegan pasta is pretty good!" It was literally just spaghetti, I found it weird that it kept being called the "vegan pasta". 2015-12-10 09:11:47 reddit post It's not veganism specifically, but people seem to forget about fiber, and how a lot of fiber calories are pooped out without ever digesting the calories (one reason for grinding your flax, too, because the outside is so fibrous, you wouldn't get nutrition- whether is calories or omegas or whatever- unless ground). Vegans in general do have a higher fiber diet because there's less processed foods available. It isn't a blanket statement of course and there are exceptions, but you can eat more calories when eating a high fiber diet. Ninja edit- it's why a lot of those vegan youtubers eat thousands of calories and don't gain weight. It's basically a laxative effect. 2015-12-10 08:05:23 reddit post Good thing we're usually more civil than relying on what biology says to dictate our actions. I hope you're a troll and not some MRA type. 2015-12-10 04:53:11 reddit post I don't watch them, but I watched some of their recent videos and I loved how they said they stopped eating meat because they aren't savages. I'm excited that they're talking about the ethics of it! 2015-12-09 04:36:25 reddit post I'm not a parent, but I'd love to raise my kid vegan. [This is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6cj6-i9q8) I saw on a raw vegan who babysits a kid (as well as have her own kid) and how she changed the way the kid she babysat ate. Raw vegan definitely seems more extreme than regular vegan but I thought it had great tips on how to get kids to eat veggies! edit: Also would like to add that Bite Size Vegan on Youtube has a series for kids on explaining why eating vegan is good, if you want to include him in the ethical side. 2015-12-07 06:55:41 reddit post I agree with you. Ineffective advocacy does exist. I really like [Unnatural Vegan's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epJfzZXCPwc) on it. 2015-12-04 19:33:48 reddit post Have you considered that you might be bi? You're still young and finding your sexuality, so it's okay to question it and sexualities do change (sexual fluidity). 2015-12-04 19:17:36 reddit post Agreed with mdma, also if you can't find GHB, there's also 1,4B. On those that haven't used GHB, you're intoxicated at a similar level as alcohol, but there's no hangover. You also must dose yourself precisely (you can overdose easily) and you must not drink alcohol or have benzos in your system because it affects the dosing. But if you get it right, it's great. Edit: also there's the studies of mdma and ptsd helping in a therapeutic setting, so I imagine it might help with other anxieties. 2015-12-04 04:02:29 reddit post OP's a student. You're usually a dependent at student-age. 2015-12-03 22:49:56 reddit post That's a great thing to add, even though you did say "accidentally", I would also say not to panic if you purposefully ate something non-vegan. I remember I went vegetarian when I was younger (maybe around 12 years old). I had a craving for beef jerky, and ate it and thought I couldn't be vegetarian anymore, so I just went back to a omni diet after that. I've been vegan now for about 5 months and no longer have crave non-vegan foods, but I think it's important for beginners to not see everything as extremely restrictive, or they might binge and/or go back to a non-vegan diet. "Slipping" is not the end of the world, even if some vegans do portray it that way. 2015-12-03 22:43:53 reddit post I often have a similar smoothie but add some avocado to it and it makes it really creamy! I sometimes do frozen berries but I'm less into fruity types of smoothies and more into creamy ones, often with cocoa or something. I always put in a few bananas as the base just to get the calories down, then everything else is flavor or nutrients. 2015-12-03 09:12:14 reddit post Re: fruit, I also really like fruits and veggies in slices. It gets boring to be at home and just eat a carrot stick plain, but when you're outside and super hungry, it tastes refreshing. I cut up a few carrots and maybe an apple and put them in a ziploc. Not as "grab and go" as prepackaged, but it's great for some road trips and stuff too. Bell peppers are good too. I try to bring hardy foods, as fruits like bananas smoosh easily. 2015-12-02 09:24:59 reddit post I have a friend that has Vegan written on her inner lip. Subtle, and intimate. I saw another that is the V with leaf sign on a guys arm. Depends on your aesthetic. Look into vegan tattoo inks, too :) Do you see veganism as dogmatic (and is that okay?) 2015-12-02 09:22:35 reddit post The term dogma definitely has a negative connotation in my mind, as I prefer to not live my life without strictness. But, with my own veganism, the stricter I am, the happier I feel because there's a direct link with less suffering. I have an ongoing conversation with my vegetarian (mostly vegan) fianc who is against the term vegan because of its connections with dogmatic ways of thinking. It's okay for me because he's doing the best he can, and even if he eats some ice cream once, he doesn't think that he has to go full dairy/egg diet. It's more about moderation instead of complete elimination for him. Honestly, I'm proud of him for making the switch and thinking of the ethics. But, he says even if he ate 100% vegan, he would never call himself a vegan, but of course it's because of stigma. I personally find pride in the label. For me, I feel best when I strive for elimination of all animal exploitation. It may be dogmatic, but I don't see a problem with it. The only problem may be sadness /guilt when I accidentally consume something I didn't have control over (like milk baked in the bread). Otherwise, I don't see an issue with striving for perfection in this case. It's difficult, because in a way my strictness is also pushing away the idea that veganism is accessible, which would be ineffective advocacy. It gets trickier when speaking about things like the idea of owning animals at all, or horseback riding, or going to zoos, or service dogs, and things like that that I haven't thought about until after my transition. We have many animals as pets (pre-vegan, all rescued). So having conversations on the ethics of this is valuable for me. My fianc on the other hand has completely disregarded my opinion on the subject and pigeon-holed me to a PETA dog-euthanizing sympathizer. I don't have specific opinions on the subject, as I'm just trying to have open conversations. Logically, by definition, I am enslaving my cat to be indoors when she clearly wants to go outside, but in practice, she is not suffering, keeping her indoors saves the lives of mice and birds. I often feed her raw meats, for her health but also mine because I have less allergies with her carnivorous diet. Is the death of chickens worth getting rid of my silly sniffles? Probably not, but in practice, I've already saved the lives of many chickens. My allergies does affect the quality of my own life, a life that I can use to spread the vegan message. Can I spread the message with a sniffly nose? Sure. Just some of my thought process. I'm very emotionally attached to the subject, but I do think some kind of logical philosophical forum would be interesting on these issues. A strict vegan may say all animal exploitation is wrong, but is it really black and white? I can understand both sides of the argument, so I find the discussion fascinating. Total midnight rant. TLDR; pretty much the title of the post. The rest is my own thoughts on it. 2015-12-02 08:32:37 reddit post I agree, it's one of the most frustrating arguments because it's made by people who could be vegetarian or vegan if it wasn't for the justification of "humane". Soooo close! It's like they can stop thinking about the abuse because they think it's been solved by some bullshit humane certification that means nothing. I've been wanting that Humane Meat Doesn't Exist shirt as my first vegan shirt, but I worry about confrontation. Fucking humane washing, humane ratings at whole foods bull shit... It literally kills animals! I wish I could be angry and shake their heads, but I know expressing my frustrations in anger can be ineffective activism. Always have to think of the animals first because I feel so emotional about the topics. 2015-12-02 08:21:41 reddit post People care about what is going on in their social circle more than outside of their social circle, as it makes a more direct impact on their lives. It's not surprising, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Facebooks algorithm also promotes your post to friends that get more likes quickly, as they program "special events" to appear more readily. So, news about having a child or weddings or whatever usually get tons of attention through algorithmic programming... I don't see anything surprising with your results... 2015-12-02 06:16:34 reddit post So excited that the top comments are on vegan diets. Totally agreed, because my most expensive things I buy pre-veganism were animal products, especially with egg prices rising to $5/dozen where I am. The ethical side is what eventually won me over, though. I do cheap staples with one specialty product per grocery trip and my groceries are usually $30-40 per week to 2 weeks. I eat oatmeal every morning, and my lunches are just dinner leftovers. Mostly beans in different forms (lentils, chili, taco bowls, tofu, TVP), veggies on sale, and a starch like rice, pasta, or potatoes. I eat lots of bananas, too, especially as "nice cream" (blended frozen bananas, I add cocoa) and smoothies in the summer. My splurge today was a $5 bottle of Califa pumpkin spice latte almond milk, but my total was still $32. 2015-12-01 19:15:39 reddit post There's tons of vegan fitness people around, and I think it's great activism to change the perception (even though I'm one of those skinny yoga girls)! Look up Patrik Baboumian, a strongman and vegan since 2011. If you haven't already heard about it, you can also check out /r/veganfitness 2015-12-01 05:27:17 reddit post Does anyone know if this is the stuff that makes you fart? You're supposed to rinse off beans to get rid of... stuff (?) that makes you fart, so wouldn't aquafaba just be that? 2015-11-30 09:09:59 reddit post Hahaha. She later sent me an email of a vegan paleo diet, but the article stated to cut back on cows milk and drink goat milk instead, and weird things like that. I literally do not care about dieting at all, and try my best to avoid bs articles like that, but good for her for looking into it. But, then she responded by giving me excuses of why she can't (she would be so sad to never eat fish again... never mind what the fish think). It's so frustrating that I didn't respond because it's hard to keep a friendly response to that. I suppose that's how MILs are tough. We have a great relationship outside of that, though. 2015-11-30 00:03:50 reddit post Seriously. I understand people need to make money, but JM seems to use youtube as a way to communicate her art and ideas, and isn't willing to compromise that for the sake of more followers/$. It's irritating when I see people I like such as Unnatural Vegan do videos on other youtubers (like the lacking protein one). I know I'll be happy after watching Jenny's videos, and not have to filter out which ones will irritate me. 2015-11-29 22:46:26 reddit post It's not a potluck, and I think it's something catered or personal chef-ed, or something. They're very wealthy (like... full time workers in their home wealthy), and my MIL brought up how she just ate around things she didn't want to eat on her plate when she visits them. So, anything I make should not try to overpower what is given to us. It's a weird situation that I'm not used to. 2015-11-29 22:40:27 reddit post I was thinking of trying this dish, Wild Rice Pilaf with Butternut Squash, Cranberries, and Pecans: http://www.onegreenplanet.org/plant-based-recipes/wild-rice-pilaf-with-butternut-squash-cranberries-and-pecans-vegan/ It's festive and filling, yet not trying to compete with a main so others will be more willing to try it. The gravy is a good idea, as if theres some potatoes or something, it would be great for me to add. 2015-11-29 21:35:20 reddit post Jenny Mustard is probably my favorite, and totally doesn't get enough love! She rarely makes health claims that a lot of vegan youtubers make. Veganism is not about bullshit health claims for me. She's Swedish, an ethical vegan, and makes beautifully aesthetic videos. I love the foods she uses in her recipes as well, generally simple ingredients, especially ingredients that can be found internationally (whole plant foods). Peaceful Cuisine is nice, but his recipes are definitely not simple and his videos are more for watching than for following. Again, beautiful aesthetics. Do you always mention you're vegan when invited to a dinner party? 2015-11-29 21:14:57 reddit post Here's a situation that I've never gone through, as I've only been vegan for about half a year. I've been invited to a Christmas dinner at some people's home that I've never met. They live in a different state, but I'll be visiting my mother-in-law and it'll be with her friends. I think there will be lots of people, I'm assuming probably 30+ people. I told my MIL that I would appreciate if she would mention that I was vegan, because it could be as simple as making the vegetable dish with olive oil instead of butter, or putting aside some mashed potatoes without cream, or leaving the cheese off a salad, or something. At the same time, she did make a point on how with her diet (basically paleo), she will make exceptions for her diet during these types of occasions. Frustratingly, I understand her point but veganism has nothing to do with diet for me, but ethics. She suggested bringing a side, which makes sense. I was thinking maybe a rice type of dish, to fill me up. We also had a discussion on how my fianc (eats mostly vegan, but generally vegetarian) would eat things he knew had animal products in this situation, where as I wouldn't. I said that maybe if I didn't know something had butter (like sauted veggies), I would eat it, but if I knew it had butter (such as labelling at a buffet), I wouldn't. I'm not sure, as I'm usually not in this situation. Should I just stick to eating the side that I would be bringing? Or would that backfire, and show that veganism is extremely restricting? Should I ask my MIL again to let them know I'm vegan? If I was lactose-intolerant, or have celiac, people would seem to be more understanding of dietary restrictions. Now I'm being seen as "picky". What do you do in these situations? TLDR: Invited to Christmas dinner with strangers, should I just bring a side to eat to avoid confrontation? 2015-11-23 03:51:30 reddit post Most people have quirks that can be OCD-like symptoms. Most people can relate to the feeling of, "What if I just jumped in front of that bus?" or something like that. It depends on how much it affects your daily living. If it's affecting your work, school, social relationships, etc, then you should seek help. An example could be, if you're often late to work because you fear harming others by driving into them so you have to take detours. Or, you have been skipping homework and doing poorly in school because you're researching the obsession. The general diagnosis is if these behaviors/thoughts affect you every day for at least 1 hour (usually it's more). As others have said, we aren't doctors. Whether you are diagnosable or not, it seems like it it causing you distress and you can seek a therapist to help you out even if you aren't within a diagnosable level of OCD. 2015-11-22 21:35:06 reddit post Could it be like derealization or depersonalization? Dissociation? I can get like that, it's a type of coping mechanism for anxiety. 2015-11-21 09:10:45 reddit post Under eating definitely increases anxiety. I've heard of a theory that it's because our body is in search-for-food-mode. So, it will run for miles to search for more food. But since we aren't running, anxiety increases. Diet tip - eat tons of high fiber fruits and veggies, and you won't need to cut back on calories. You'll end up pooping out a lot of the calories from the fiber, but you'll still feel satiated since you're eating high volume. Don't forget to drink water, too, because fiber takes a lot of water to digest.

Had a beautiful '85 and I loved it, even though it was the most unreliable POS ever. The Vulcan V6 is absolute trash and blew gaskets left and right. The 2.3 4 banger was a much better (and Mazda) engine. I don't think it's possible to find one with the original V6 engine. Everyone swapped 302s into them because it was so simple. 2017-05-15 14:13:55 reddit post Uhh what? Ford has been doing phenomenal the past decade in pretty much every aspect. Truck? F-series.

At least on earlier models. Looking for new shocks. Any suggestions or tips? 2017-05-06 18:50:56 reddit post Well, my YJ has the stock shocks that came with it from the factory 22 years ago and are all completely shot. Ride quality is absolutely horrible and I can't stand it anymore. My Jeep is stock other than a 3" body lift and 33"s and I seem to be in the market for new shocks. I was thinking either [These from Quadratrac](https://www.quadratec.com/p/quadratec/maximum-duty-nitro-80-shock-kit-87-95-jeep-wrangler-yj) or [These from Quadratrac](https://www.quadratec.com/p/quadratec/maximum-duty-hydro-70-shock-kit-87-95-jeep-wrangler-yj) Any other options? These seem pretty good for the price based on reviews. I don't do any major offroading other than some trails and my YJ is my daily driver to and from school and work (about 30 min both ways). 2017-05-05 19:05:23 reddit post Nope. It's mostly dirt trails. There really aren't any obstacles except for a branch or some dips 2017-05-05 19:00:14 reddit post /r/meirl 2017-05-04 23:34:03 reddit post I'm thinking a YJ that was converted to front coils, which isn't uncommon. Those rear leafs look exactly like the ones on my YJ. And the frame is the exact same shape. Also, I don't know of anyone who would convert a TJ to leafs. 2017-05-03 20:20:04 reddit post Yeah, it's a 22 year old Jeep. I don't want to break anything, although that still happens way to often, which is why I'm a bit puzzled. 2017-05-03 19:00:13 reddit post Nope. Unless 5 mph is too fast. 2017-05-03 12:56:41 reddit post Well, YJs are already the ugly duckling of jeeps and this trim just accentuates that. Personally I love it. I wish I could have found one, but ended up with my plain ol' 95 instead. I have a wierd taste in cars though (i.e the AMC Pacer or Ford Pinto is a dream vehicle for me). I love ugly '80s cars. 2017-05-03 12:53:30 reddit post Everytime I got off-road something breaks! Last time it was my diff cover, oil pan gasket, radiator, and gas tank skid plate (still functional but cracked). All because I bottomed out. It was just a trail too, nothing remotely major. What do? It's a 1995 YJ btw. It's in great shape (except some minor tub rust) so I don't get it. My brother has a '95 in way worse shape and it never has these issues. I'm really starting to think of selling it just because I can't deal with then repair costs so often (even if I don't go off-road). 2017-05-03 12:49:16 reddit post A hose. 100% serious. Once a year I take all my seats and carpeting out, park on a hill (previous owner beckoned over the drain plugs :P) and spray the crap out of the inside. Then I let it drain and dry and rebedline any areas that need it and reinstall everything. This may or may not works quite so we'll with more modern Jeep's. 2017-05-03 12:40:31 reddit post I still do it occasionally if I don't want to use up what little phone data I have.

It's so much quicker 2017-05-02 20:26:39 reddit post I'm slogging through it. Its fault lies in the fact that most if the characters I really don't care about and don't contribute at all to the overall story hat much. It's all side characters.

Not to mention the whole book is a slog so far. 2017-05-01 21:24:18 reddit post Can't even use it because I lost the plastic bolt that holds the wiper motor to the windshield frame, so it bangs around the opening in the frame. It's getting fixed soon courtesy of a fellow /r/jeep er who is sending me the part. I couldn't be more grateful to him. 2017-05-01 21:14:39 reddit post Seriously. A lot of girls I talk to are obsessed over the fact that I have a Jeep. They all want to ride in it They're chick magnets I swear.

Cleveland has some fantastic bridges from the 20's and 30's that are still great. The problem is the road surface. It's always being repaired due to the constant freeze/thaw cycle that absolutely destroys the road surface (especially in NE Ohio, where we get the lake effect). I just wish they would stop salting the roads in the winter. We also don't really have any trains (other than freight), but that is more due to a lack of need. 2017-05-01 02:46:08 reddit post Nope. They're all long gone or in private junkyards 2017-04-30 19:50:47 reddit post It comes with the entire wiper motor assembly, but I can't afford to buy it for just the one part. 2017-04-30 18:13:09 reddit post You do realize you're on a satire sub dedicated to American nationalism right?

I'm going out of my mind trying to find a part for my YJ 2017-04-30 14:17:18 reddit post So recently I was driving during a thunderstorm and my windshield wiper arm flew off. Ok, no big deal, stopped the Jeep and picked up the arm and wiper, said I'll put it back on later and went on my way. Well as it turns out the reason it flew off is because the cheap plastic bolt/clamp thing that holds the wiper motor to the windshield frame snapped and fell off somewhere. I am going out of my mind trying to find a replacement part. They just don't exist it seems. Doesn't anyone know where I can find the part? I'll upload pics in a minute to show what I mean. Thanks.

That's pretty neat actually, since I bet the donor YJ was completely rusted out (they tend to do that).l, and this is a cheap and pretty cool swap. 2017-04-29 14:36:24 reddit post I think that's exactly what's happening. 2017-04-29 14:35:46 reddit post Hell no 2017-04-29 00:48:41 reddit post Hello!

Over half of my thoughts are usually filled with guilt of how I need to purge and get food out of my body, but I know if I relapse I'd lose my job and drop out of the culinary program that I'm in. 2014-03-31 22:18:12 reddit post I am feeling slightly better. It is raining hard outside and I hear thunder. I'm just in bed, I don't know if I'm well enough to go to the gym today..I haven't gone in awhile.

Society should learn to accept autistic people instead of trying to find a cure. 2016-05-01 23:01:13 reddit post If you don't know what autism is, it is basically a neuro developmental disorder and is characterised by difficulties with social interaction, verbal and non verbal communication and restricted and repetitive movements. What I am saying here is that people should accept autism as a different way of seeing the world and not as a disease. Autism should be something that is celebrated instead of anti vaxxer moms posting online about how they 'cured' their autistic child by giving them a gluten-free, sugar-free organic diet. Having autism is not the worst thing to happen to someone, organisations like Autism Speaks shouldn't spread fear and act like autistic people are puzzles that need to be fixed.

Going after lawyers for doing their jobs makes me uneasy, but I suppose if she was unprofessional about it then that's a valid criticism. 2016-04-22 15:52:27 reddit post Folks, I hate Hillary as much as the next guy but this is something we can't go after her for. She was a defense attorney, she defended her client. That's her job. Even scumbag rapist child molesters have the right to a lawyer, and the justice system doesn't work unless defense attorneys represent their clients' interests to the best of their ability.

Leviathan's would be a crazy good commander, 3 mana draw 2 always available? 2016-04-13 19:41:26 reddit post This guy I play Magic with is an obnoxious asshole. He's a judge, so he acts like he's always right about the rules and most of us believe him. But I've caught him lying about the rules twice now. Not just mistakes, no, he *made up rules* that didn't exist specifically to give himself an advantage in the game. He's constantly belittling and insulting me and my friends (it seems like half of what comes out of his mouth is the word "stupid"). He argues about everything, insisting that we play the way that is most advantageous to him. He argues for penalties when others make mistakes, and argues for leniency when he makes them. And he's extremely selfish. Last night he sold me a 2015 Commander deck for 25$, which is 15$ off the sticker price. I counted the cards and, lo and behold, there were 7 cards missing. He said he just took out a few of the cheap ones. I haven't checked the value of the missing cards but I'm positive that one of them cost 3$, not cheap by any stretch. I'm not sure why I trusted him in the first place. 2016-04-09 18:16:05 reddit post Rune Factory!

Rather than a bribe to get you out of jail, it's a way for the state to ensure that you stick around for your trial.

If a gun manufacturer was advertising their product as a great way to shoot up a high school, then yeah I'd hold them accountable. But there's no reason that a gun maker who advertises guns for deer hunting should be held responsible for any murder committed with their weapons. I don't think you would hold Cutco responsible if one of their knives was used as a murder weapon. 2016-04-06 06:15:44 reddit post SAVAGE 2016-04-05 17:35:46 reddit post I've been thinking about this ever since clues were announced. I'm toying with the idea of going Jeskai or even Boros, since [[Thraben Inspector]] helps round out the curve and [[Bygone Bishop]] makes them relevant mid/late-game. Green gets a lot of mileage out of clues, but doesn't do well at creating them. The best you get is [[Tireless Tracker]] giving you 1 clue per turn, or [[Ulvenwald Mysteries]]. Blue has good clue creation only if you have the support for it. [[Ongoing Investigations]] and [[Trail of Evidence]] are too inconsistent if we're building around Aether Grid. [Erdwal Illuminator]] is excellent for any clue deck. In the end, I decided to throw caution to the wind and build Jeskai Clues.

Takeaways: That 1/3 Skulk Lifelink as a 3-drop is way better than it looks. Functionally a "drain 1 life per turn". Ethereal Guidance is a sleeper hit. A good white deck is going to have TONS of 1/1 flyers, I had 5 on the board at one point and my main color was green. Pumping all of them is great value. Delirium is hard af to get online.

You won't want it on turn 2, but dropping it turn 3 with fiery temper is game-changeingly good. 2016-03-30 20:30:51 reddit post I think you're overlooking the versatility of Sanitarium Skeleton. It's not just 2B to save you a discard, it's also 3B to save you a sacrifice. It can be returned at instant speed, so if you have untapped mana saved for combat tricks you can still tap it for value if your opponent doesn't swing. 2016-03-30 19:10:45 reddit post I agree. It has a huge advantage of being both recursively discard-able and sacrifice-able. Late in the game, when you're topdecking, you'll have a lot of free mana during the opponent's turn. As we saw in the LRR event, you can use that to return Sanitarium Skeleton after you block with it. 2016-03-30 06:52:54 reddit post Build a dike and make *the ocean* pay for it. 2016-03-24 18:53:49 reddit post I've actually been building this character on-and-off for a few months now.

But isn't that what adderall is for? Helping people focus? I don't see how that's considered abusing the drug. And I've even seen the term used in the context of people prescribed adderall using it to study, so it isn't just illegal use. So what does "abusing" a drug actually mean? I can't transfer into the major I want, and all my other options suck 2016-03-20 09:14:20 reddit post I want to transfer into cs, but I need a 3.2 gpa and I only have a 3.0. I go to a tech school, so majoring outside of STEM is a waste of time and money. So my options are basically chemistry, physics, biology and math. I hate the first three, and though I love math I cannot stand taking more than 1 math class per semester. I'm so lost. I really feel like I fucked up irreversibly, and I'm honestly considering killing myself. When I planned my college life, I kept my depression in mind. I made sure I always had a backup plan, so I would never feel like life was hopeless if I fucked up. Well, I ran out of backup plans. If I can't transfer into a major I'm ok with, I'm just a waste of time and money. 2016-03-18 23:37:20 reddit post Honestly? Too many variables, not enough letters.

I really enjoyed the two programming classes that I took in HS, but I'm terrified of the possibility that I will be sitting in a desk all day doing nothing but typing code on a computer. IT on the other hand looks promising. I figure it involves a lot of hands-on, physical work with computers, which appeals to me. My worry is the job market. Programmers are well-paid and in high demand. And a CS major is versatile, it could lead to a job in almost any computer-based field. Does IT offer that same kind of flexibility?

There's good reason to oppose him, so if that's the way the leadership wants to go I don't expect them to have too much trouble. But it wouldn't be a tragedy if this guy ends up on the SCOTUS. That said, I can't find any info about his abortion stance, and I would be MUCH more comfortable with a justice who I know is pro-life. 2016-03-16 20:48:33 reddit post Everything about that would have been hysterical. 2016-03-16 15:18:39 reddit post Trump isn't wrong when he calls Cruz "Lyin' Ted." I can think of several instances where he has told out and out lies on tv. That, *that* is a good reason to fear a candidate. Constantly telling blatant lies to advance their own ambitions. But still, on that front he isn't nearly as bad as Trump. 2016-03-16 13:59:19 reddit post The President has been overstepping the bounds of executive authority for decades. Our ideal president should be one who *can't* get anything done, even if he tried. That administration would see the power of governance returned to its rightful place in Congress. 2016-03-16 13:48:32 reddit post See? This is what I'm hearing: 1. He's unwilling to compromise 2. The GOP don't like him 3. He's generally unlikable 4. He has an annoying face These are all really bad reasons to dislike a candidate. If you agreed with him, you wouldn't want him to compromise his views. If you don't like the Republican establishment, then point 2 is actually a plus. And personal likability is *totally* irrelevant to effective administration. I know there are good reasons to oppose Cruz. His tax plan is madness, he's wrong about climate change, his immigration policy would hurt the country, etc. But these aren't reasons to *hate* him, just to *disagree* with him. 2016-03-16 13:31:53 reddit post Ok, I'm real confused about this. Why does everyone hate Cruz so much? Like, I don't *like* him, I don't even *agree* with him, but why are people treating him like he's an absolute tyrant? He's probably the most small-government guy left in the running. 2016-03-16 10:07:10 reddit post I will vote for the Libertarian nominee. As the largest third party in America, they have the best chance at gaining a spot at the table with the big two. And this year both major candidates will be hugely unpopular, so there's a decent chance the Libertarian will participate in the debates. 2016-03-09 10:41:15 reddit post My main complaint this season was that it was too predictable/the foreshadowing was too easy. I saw a handful of things coming ahead of time (assassination, VP, Seth v Doug, Doug and the widow...) and I don't think I have an overly keen sense of storytelling. I felt the past seasons caught us by surprise more often. Yeah, the foreshadowing was pretty obvious. When Frank traced Meechum's hand on the wall I literally said out loud, "Meechum's going to die, and someone's going to paint over the handprint, and Frank's going to be pissed." It was very predictable. 2016-03-09 10:34:39 reddit post Ok to be fair the original House of Cards was heavily based upon Richard III and Macbeth. If you've seen both of them, these parallels are easy to see. 2016-03-09 03:37:16 reddit post Politifact leans left. If you read a few of the articles that were labeled "mostly false," "half-true" or "mostly true," you can see that they are more inclined to apply negative labels to conservatives after reaching essentially the same conclusions about the facts. 2016-03-08 21:02:07 reddit post Well, it happens. The GOP has a TON of debates, and this cycle they've been hosted by CNN, NBC, and MSNBC at some point. Fox News, particularly Fox Business, tends to run good, policy-oriented debates, and I don't think that would change too much if it was a Democratic debate. If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, what would be his best choice for a running mate? 2016-03-08 09:46:18 reddit post [removed] 2016-03-08 03:37:09 reddit post I agree, but he deliberately ran to the center in this primary campaign, so the perception is that he is moderate. 2016-03-08 01:25:32 reddit post he's not a conservative he's running without specific policies possible abuse of power This describes every nearly establishment Republican. Not really though. The last two "establishment" candidates in the running, Rubio and Kasich, are both very conservative (though Kasich has deliberately tried to run as a moderate). They're running with very clear policies that have been mostly consistent throughout their political careers, the only notable exception being Rubio on immigration. And nobody but Trump has proposed such abuses of power as war crimes. 2016-03-07 21:17:59 reddit post The problem with Kasich is that he is perceived as too moderate. More conservative voters might not bother coming out to vote if Kasich is the nominee. Rubio is the establishment choice because he's electable enough to sway independents but conservative enough to bring hard-line Republicans out to vote. 2016-03-07 19:13:00 reddit post This would be an excellent card to manifest cheat in. 2016-03-06 21:49:38 reddit post Romania's anthem sounds deliciously fascist. 2016-03-06 18:58:09 reddit post Holy shit, 1. Lucas gets arrested and openly speaks about a conspiracy against him by Frank Underwood, 2. Lucas meets Dunbar, 3. Lucas shoots Underwood. That's going to look mighty suspicious. 2016-03-06 18:27:28 reddit post On the contrary, the only honest way to present an opinion is as fact. If I said "I think Nixon is a great president" my statement would be factually true. But in saying "Nixon is a great president" I am stating only an opinion. 2016-03-06 18:13:32 reddit post TBH Nixon was a damn good president. Watergate soured his legacy, for good reason, but if it wasn't for that he'd definitely be in my top 10. 2016-03-06 18:08:56 reddit post Ok, thanks! 2016-03-06 17:22:41 reddit post Does she count as red when flipped?

Was he always this popular, or is his fame a new thing? 2016-03-05 07:38:25 reddit post Yeah Shapiro is a huge fan of Ted Cruz. My original comment was based on the assumption that Trump and Hillary will each be their party's nominee. And the assumption that Ben would even bother voting in that election lol. 2016-03-05 02:15:06 reddit post Shapiro wrote an article about how he would never vote for Trump, and that he's worse than Clinton. 2016-03-04 23:08:14 reddit post I liked Rubio before this. I still like him, because I think his immature jokes are just as repulsive to him as to me. 2016-03-04 23:01:54 reddit post Jim Webb voting Republican and Ben Shapiro voting Democrat. This election is weird. 2016-03-02 16:48:35 reddit post A lot of this evidence is anecdotal, so it's difficult to cite reliably in a debate. Any sources for an argument that abortion is *never* medically necessary? 2016-03-02 16:47:21 reddit post He mentioned in passing that "... the vast, vast majority of medical concerns occur at 24, 25, 26 weeks of pregnancy." 2016-03-02 05:33:50 reddit post "We are not defined by sexual attraction. We are not defined by sexual behavior," he continued. "We are sons and daughters of God, and all of us have different challenges in the flesh." 2016-03-02 05:33:40 reddit post If you actually read the article, it's really not homophobic. 2016-03-02 05:20:55 reddit post Cruz is no more selfish than any other candidate running. I'd argue that Rubio is more self-serving, because if he dropped out and endorsed Cruz then Ted would get most of that support. But if Cruz drops out, there's no guarantee that his supporters would back Rubio any more than Trump. 2016-03-01 23:18:23 reddit post This is honestly the best settlement I've ever seen. It looks amazing. Did you use mods, or is it vanilla? 2016-03-01 21:09:30 reddit post buying college This is such a concise way of putting it, I'm surprised I haven't heard it until now. You don't "go" to college, it's not a vacation from life, it's a product you buy. If you buy it as an investment, don't expect it to always be fun. If you buy it as a luxury, don't expect it to advance your career. EDIT: Yes I realize the post's grammar is shite overall but this is a good way to frame the reasons people attend college. 2016-03-01 19:18:00 reddit post It would have been ridiculous to rule any other way. If the court tried to force a Priest to violate the sanctity of confession, he'd probably just take the contempt of court charge. 2016-03-01 16:52:12 reddit post Oh, woops. My bad. 2016-03-01 06:55:56 reddit post Virginia 2016-03-01 06:47:39 reddit post Ok so this article is mostly bullshit, but Cromwell was still terrible. He was personally responsible for the attempted Irish genocide during his campaigns, and he was overall an intolerant, tyrannical sectarian dictator, I'm currently in my home state, but not my home county. Can I vote in the Super Tuesday primary today? 2016-03-01 06:38:54 reddit post Yes, my state is a super Tuesday state. I made the mistake of confusing my absentee ballot application form with an actual absentee ballot, so I didn't make the absentee deadline. Can I still show up with a state driver's license and vote at my local polling place tomorrow? 2016-02-26 21:50:30 reddit post Anger and relief are not mutually exclusive. Of course I'm upset that my fellow Christians are being persecuted for their faith. I pity those Muslims who respond to the Word with such hate, and who do not know the love of God. But yeah, I'm relieved that they aren't being beheaded. 2016-02-23 20:00:24 reddit post Ol' Aarfy's never paid for it. 2016-02-22 18:05:10 reddit post We aren't talking about barring them from anything. I used a poor example for my point here. Back before the SCOTUS decision on gay marriage, one could make the argument that gay people are so small a fraction of the population that even considering the issue is a waste of federal resources. The fact is that a gender neutral system drastically increases the percentage of bathroom interactions with people who are sexually attracted to you. This also increases the number of people who might act on that. If we can agree that the amount of sexual assaults from a group is proportional to the population of that group, then the number of victims of homosexual sexual assault is proportional to the number of homosexuals. If the former is a small enough proportion to dismiss, surely so is the latter? Surely we shouldn't have to consider homosexuals when making policy decisions, right? If the complaint about a certain policy is that it discriminates against homosexuals, then under this argument a valid response would be "there aren't enough homosexuals for that to matter." Again, I'm not necessarily opposed to these arguments. We dismiss small constituencies all the time in the democratic process, often purely for the convenience of the majority. But you have to be willing to accept that if you're going to make the argument. 2016-02-22 17:24:44 reddit post That's a dangerous argument to apply, though. I could easily say, then, that gays are such a small part of the population that barring them from military service (so they don't make straight people uncomfortable) is a minor injustice outweighed by the benefits. I could say that trans people are such a small part of the population that gender neutral bathrooms aren't worth the cost. I'm not saying these are bad arguments, but you have to be comfortable making them if you're going to make the "negligible proportion" claim. 2016-02-22 15:14:32 reddit post If we're going to treat gay people equally, we have to either disregard the "sexual predation" argument or conclude that all bathrooms should be single-occupant. 2016-02-10 17:57:56 reddit post *Romney* shots fired? I'd say calling Catholics not Christian is much more savage than applying the same label to Mormons. 2016-02-10 17:25:01 reddit post I like it! I do think the white field with stars on the whole hoist is a bit much though. It's similar enough in length to the fly that the flag might look symmetrical "in the wild," so to speak. Have you considered just using the white field for the canton? What are some good things to pay attention to that most people don't notice? 2016-02-04 17:07:47 reddit post 2016-02-04 04:18:20 reddit post Hilary probably. Most of the president's actual job is foreign affairs, and Bernie had no fucking clue what he's doing. 2016-02-03 22:09:44 reddit post College. I'm usually good with being reasonable and understanding the other side, and in hindsight I've concluded that her real problem was that she treated me like a child. She didn't trust a word I said, ignored me when I told her that I was no danger to anyone, and at one point even said "nothing you say will convince me [not to call the director]." I have no patience for this bullshit. If I need to talk to someone, I'll find a friend. 2016-02-03 20:53:17 reddit post Right? That's what I said. I told them "this contract guarantees confidentiality except if I threaten someone or there's a court order. I haven't threatened anyone, so unless you have a warrant you can't reveal anything." My school's counseling center is awful 2016-02-03 18:52:28 reddit post I go in for my initial appointment. I'm feeling pretty good about myself, finally took action to solve my problems. They have me fill out a ~15 minute survey, then I go into a counselor's office. We talk for a bit about a bunch of topics (family, friends, school, etc). Then she starts asking about anger. See, I responded on the survey that I "considered physically harming others" and "felt anger often." I told her that I answered truthfully, that I, like every other human being, often experience the basic emotion of anger, and that the instinctive reaction to anger is violence. I made a point of saying that although I often feel anger, and fantasize about violence, I am a rational human being with self-control and I have never acted on it and never planned to. But she just would not leave this topic alone. I kept telling her that I didn't want to hurt anybody. I'm probably physically incapable of it. In fact, I broke up with my girlfriend last week because she got angry and pushed me over, and I don't tolerate people using violence to solve their problems. But no matter what I said, she just kept putting on this faux-worried face and saying "I'm concerned." Well, after an hour I had had enough of that. I told her that I wouldn't be scheduling another appointment, and that I would be leaving now. So she *threatened to break confidentiality* and alert the police on the grounds that she thought I was a danger to others. She told me I couldn't leave! Had me wait in her office while she got the director. While I was waiting, I reread the contract and saw that she had NO FUCKING GROUNDS to break confidentiality. Her "concern" is not enough, I would have had to make a *threat of serious harm* to others. I talked to the director for like 5 minutes, told him I wasn't coming back, and that if the counselor violated confidentiality they would both be hearing from my attorney. I came in to be treated for depression, and they tried to call the fucking police. Mind you, I'm not a delicate eggshell here. I was cool and rational the entire way, I didn't feel like I was making myself uncomfortably vulnerable. It isn't like I was timid and a small mistake could drive me away. It took a real serious fuck-up to make me give up on them. 2016-01-27 18:53:25 reddit post A friend of mine actually wrote a novel-length Richard III fanfic with this concept.

Has anyone else had a bad experience with delegates from Northeastern University? 2016-01-13 05:32:57 reddit post I'm not here to complain about any specific delegates, or their school, or their program. In our last conference we saw the Northeastern delegates behaving unprofessionally. The issues were specific to the delegates from that school, and my concerns were shared by several other delegations attending the conference. The head delegate for Northeastern, when responding to the concerns at the head delegate meeting, seemed to imply that these were recurring problems. I don't want to paint the whole team with a broad brush, or get into a fight about their behavior. We will probably be seeing them at future conferences, and I'm just trying to find the extent of the issues with their delegate behavior. Has anyone else experienced working with Northeastern delegates before? Was your experience similar? Also, if anyone reading is from Northeastern University's MUN team, PLEASE RESPOND. The last thing I want is to wrongfully malign another team, so I would appreciate your perspective on the matter. 2016-01-05 04:24:42 reddit post I had an incredible New Years! From 18:00 on December 31 to 02:00 January 2 we played a metric shit-ton of board games. Started with **Battlestar Galactica**, then **Twilight Imperium**, both of which I've played before. Then we started **Virgin Queen**, a first for all but one of us, but we only got through 2 turns. After that, we did a group favorite **Game of Thrones**. After a nap we played **Middle Earth Quest**, and I finally got to play Sauron. I lost, but it was a blast anyways. We rounded out the marathon with 3 missions of **Star Wars: Imperial Assault**, which I LOVED. I made the mistake of picking Mak Eshka'rey, so I wasn't terribly successful, but it was good fun nonetheless. 2016-01-01 06:24:09 reddit post Unanimously. 2016-01-01 06:22:28 reddit post Won WWII and forced France to accept war guilt. 2015-12-31 22:20:29 reddit post Also a few months ago I was in a Turkish Cabinet crisis, and we got an update about Syrian refugees.

How do I politely remind my cousin about a gift he promised me? 2015-12-26 07:09:55 reddit post So Dec 23 I was playing Magic TCG with my cousins. I don't own a magic deck, and I liked the one my cousin lent me. He basically said, "well, I'm never going to use it, so keep it. Merry Christmas." I was hesitant to accept because I didn't get him anything, but I told him that I would accept it because I was going shopping later and I could get him something. Christmas day, I give him his gift. He doesn't mention the deck. So when we play Magic with our other cousins, I ask to use that deck. He gives it to me, and at the end of the night, takes it back. He didn't mention any intent to gift it to me. I didn't get any gifts for any of my other cousins, and I very clearly and overtly signaled to him that I would like the deck. Another thing to mention is that my cousin has mild Asperger's. I fear he may have forgotten, and not picked up on any of my signals. Not to sound like a dick, but how do I get him to give me the deck without insulting him? If there's a better sub for this, please redirect me to it. Thanks! EDIT: To clarify, I didn't turn the gift down, I just said that I'd get him something in return. 2015-12-23 00:22:54 reddit post I hate him because he ruined a cool name, and a cool outfit, and a bunch of cool imagery...

subject3094 [QUESTION] Supplements on a budget: What are you bottom line must-haves? 2014-08-21 18:09:51 reddit post Hello ladies! As a mother of a two year old with a boyfriend and a mortgage, we are currently attempting to overhaul our budget and start saving a lot more than we do right now. My boyfriend doesn't exercise or go to the gym whatsoever and has no plans to, which is fine. I however do, and being rather new to supplements, I just sort of bought a little of everything that I see people using. I currently use protein powder, a BCAA powder (I do fasted training in the AM), fish oil, creatine, green tea extract, a fat burner, and a daily multivitamin. I feel like I need to cut back, but I have no idea which supplements I should do without. What do you guys use, and what have you gotten rid of? I know some supplementing is important but I just can't continue to spend what I do on everything. My boyfriend (26M) and I (23F) have a toddler, a mortgage, and student loans for days. Not entirely sure on how to proceed. 2014-08-20 23:53:51 reddit post For starters, here's our current budget: **Monthly income: $3420 (lowballed; he works on commission)** **Monthly Expenses** Daycare: $516 Groceries: $500 Household Extras: $100 Electricity: $160 Mortgage: $490 Water/Trash: $70 Credit Card 1 (mine): $25 Credit Card 2 (mine): $30 Credit Card 3 (his): $55 Credit Card 4 (his): $45 Student Loan Payments: $178 Truck Payment: $100 Cable/Internet: $190 Cell Phone: $70 Gas: $150 Netflix/Hulu: $18 Gym: $33 Car Insurance: $75 Clothing: $50 Entertainment: $75 Lawn: $25-50 **Total Monthly Expenses: $3010** **Monthly Leftover Cash: $410-ish** This looks to put us at about $410 leftover at the end of each month. I have no idea how good or bad this is. As of right now, we do not have an emergency fund of any kind. I guess I didn't realize how important this was until I started following this subreddit. We've been very fortunate to not have any real emergencies, so I guess I've just sort of looked the other way. If I understand right, our emergency fund should have at minimum $8652, and by reading the FAQ I saw that the first thing we should focus on is building that up. However, I guess my question is this: If our budget is exactly precise which I know it won't be, we would have to focus on building only that for the next 21 months. Am I right that we shouldn't focus on paying down debts until we have built this fund? Or is there some way we should be doing both? He has about $1300 of credit card debt and I have about $1200. My interest rates on my two cards are at about 18.5%, and I'm not currently sure about his. I was always under the impression that paying the minimum only each month lowers your credit score. Is that incorrect? I know carrying a high percentage of balance on the card does. I've been doing so much reading here lately that I'm really overwhelmed. As far as 401k, he is already contributing the highest amount that his company matches, so we're good there. My job doesn't offer a 401k, but I have one left over from my last job. What should I do with that? I'm really motivated to turn our financial situation around; I'm tired of constantly living paycheck to paycheck with zero future plans financially. I really don't know how bad of shape we're in because all of our friends are still in school and without children or mortgages or responsibilities whatsoever, so there's little for me to compare to. Any input you guys might have would be greatly appreciated! 2014-08-17 04:26:02 reddit post Front tooth gap in females. I am a female.

Thinking about it the opposite way is a great idea! That totally makes sense. I'm recovering from an ED and I went from being about 15 pounds underweight to about 20 pounds overweight, so I have hit every spot on the spectrum as far as crazy binges and restriction.

Thank you for the helpful advice! 2014-08-11 17:52:43 reddit post I'm definitely seeing an increase in my strength; all my lifts have gone up and that's really exciting! I am recovered from anorexia so I definitely struggle with seeing changes in my body, but I have noticed some definition in my arms that I like. I try not to weigh myself too much. I guess my main issue is that I'm impatient: when you just don't eat, you tend to lose weight quickly and that's what I'm used to. (NOT AT ALL promoting it as a solution -- anorexia is a sure way to destroy your mind and your body). While I'm LOVING finally feeling healthy and strong instead of shaky and close to death, waiting to see any real results is torture. I love lifting, hate cardio. But that seems to be the norm for most people, haha. The macro planning is a little stressful for me -- moderation has never really been my strong suit. However I ultimately enjoy the foods I'm eating. I get a little tired of the repetition of eating the same foods, but with a two year old and a full time job I don't really have time to plan out different meals for myself every day on top of cooking for the fam. I wish I would have taken measurements, but I've been told that with the ED recovery, it's better not to. 2014-08-11 17:14:38 reddit post I look forward to mine all week too! And I always feel super motivated until AFTER. That's when I feel like I screwed everything up.
subject3132 To what extent can we rely on the perception of the artist to represent history? 2015-10-24 11:20:33 reddit post Hello all /r/history dwellers! I have been thinking a lot the past few days about artistic representations of art in history and how their representation of the history can be influenced by their perception? Is the history that is thus being represented, reliable? Is it false history? What are some examples of art pieces that may misrepresent a historic event?

Only last week were the oats increased from 30 to 50 in the breakfast option and afternoon shake. The nut content for each meal was also doubled. It was initially really hard to eat all the food, though it has gotten easier. The hardest part of my day in terms of food is the final banana of the day. I love bananas but they're so filling.

Anyhow, I am at a loss at how to move forward regarding my TOK presentation. I know that I want to discuss history and have generated a few ideas from this. They are: * Does historical knowledge exist to ensure there is no doubt of the past? * (something pertaining to the following quote) - "The aim of the historian, like that of the artist, is to enlarge our picture of the world, to give us a new way of looking at things." (James Joll). Maybe something like "How subjective is historical knowledge to interpretation?" I don't know whether these are too broad or not and would like to know if anyone here can help me pick/formulate a decent KQ. Thanks in advance! 2015-10-05 07:26:08 reddit post I normally keep Sunday, Monday and Tuesday in the Fridge. Then on Tuesday night, I will take the next day out of the fridge.

It was really motivating to read all your comments and messages :) I was able to stay on track with my eating last week and have (hopefully) done week 3 justice with these meals. I switched around some of the veg, got rid of the beef (it made my stomach hurt) and bought some new spices for the fish and chicken! Speaking of chicken, I bought some shish taouk (lebanese grilled chicken variant) spices. Normally, yogurt is used to mix with the spices and then marinade the chicken, though since I didn't have any yogurt lying around, I used CAMEL MILK! Yes, camel milk. It is slightly 'saltier' than regular milk though quite light on the stomach. It can be a bit pungent if not fresh though. The sweet potato this round was roasted cut into cubes with some spices (lots of cayenne pepper) and the quinoa was cooked in a rice cooker. Thanks to those that suggested I do that. It is a great improvement from last week :) EDIT: Apologies for the recipes not being that detailed. If you would like more info, don't hesitate to ask. They are quite simple. ALSO, I just had some of the camel milk chicken... IT IS GREAT and tender and yum.

It seems as though I'm the only person in my friend group or of anyone that I ask, whose parents didn't save up for university. Thus, I have to pay for it along with my own rent (my friends' parents also pay their rent). My mom has apologized a lot, saying that they were so pressed for money that saving for us was impossible. I tell her it doesn't really matter, but deep down it bothers me that I have to pay for it myself while everyone else doesn't.

Especially those people who stand outside clinics with those awful posters and then whine when people yell at them. A woman who is going into the clinic is literally already feeling not that great and then to see that...it must be so hard. 2016-01-30 06:29:50 reddit post While I was on accutane I was eating next to nothing and it still worked. I just read someone's blog post about abortion and want to cry out of frustration. What are your views on abortion? 2016-01-30 06:22:28 reddit post I stumbled across someone's blog post about how happy they are that an abortion clinic is closing. I actually had to take a moment and try to not throw my phone at the wall. I have and always will be pro-choice. In no way am I gung-ho for abortion, but I believe that a woman should be allowed to have a choice. I just can't believe there are some women out there who vehemently stand against a person having a choice such as this. 2016-01-29 23:15:21 reddit post It's almost impossible to not open a bag of smart food and only have one serving 2016-01-29 23:14:51 reddit post You speak my language 2016-01-29 23:14:17 reddit post Hazelnuts are the king of nuts 2016-01-29 23:13:12 reddit post Oh man that's some serious PB love 2016-01-29 23:12:06 reddit post Oh man I need to try that 2016-01-29 23:11:34 reddit post Holy shit!

If you're looking for a healthier version try to make your own out of day old bread and just broil it in the oven until it's crunchy. I add some olive oil and garlic and TBH it tastes better than any other crouton I've had 2016-01-29 20:00:47 reddit post I really want to try Reese's PB but it's so expensive here in comparison to skippy or Kraft 2016-01-29 20:00:15 reddit post I did this but cracked when I realized how much I missed it 2016-01-29 19:59:48 reddit post I think the combo of chocolate and hazelnuts, plus the crunchy and silky textures are just perfect 2016-01-29 19:58:39 reddit post Have you tried cashew butter?

How can I get over my fear of calories? 2016-01-27 18:13:02 reddit post I've been battling with an eating disorder for the past year. I've made strides in getting better and want to start a 1200 cal diet. To me 1200 calories still seems like a lot. I'm scared I will gain weight from eating that much and am not leading a very active lifestyle at the moment. I hate eating bread or anything considered "bad" for you (although my weakness is peanut butter). How should I go about starting this diet? 2016-01-22 18:02:03 reddit post I love making these! They're super yummy and aren't eggy at all. Yours look perfect! 2016-01-20 03:22:36 reddit post Just from personal experience How much do you guys enjoy sexting? 2016-01-20 01:45:30 reddit post I asked r/AskWomen if they enjoyed sexting and the answers were mixed. How do guys enjoy it so much? Do you really get hot and bothered by it? To be honest, most girls sexting are sitting in their PJs watching TV not bothered one bit. 2016-01-20 01:42:12 reddit post *jude voice* "Dudeee" 2016-01-19 23:24:32 reddit post "Haha and then what;)" 2016-01-19 23:17:18 reddit post Ahhhh that theme song though Do you guys enjoy sexting? 2016-01-19 23:15:33 reddit post I don't mean just sending pictures but also dirty texting etc etc. I find I'll just be texting and it won't get me going. Sometimes I'll laugh and find it entertaining. I find it funny how guys get all hot and bothered while I'm sitting there eating a burrito and painting my nails. 2016-01-19 23:09:36 reddit post It had its quirks haha but the whole real faces and eyes were just...odd 2016-01-19 23:07:36 reddit post For me: Fillmore, big comfy couch, Jacob two-two, art attack, Mona the vampire, Martians weird mysteries 2016-01-19 23:06:21 reddit post Bananas in pyjamas were the best 2016-01-19 23:06:04 reddit post That show was so creepy What's a show from your childhood everyone seems to have forgot about? 2016-01-19 23:00:22 reddit post 2016-01-18 21:14:07 reddit post No problem! 2016-01-18 21:13:00 reddit post Recipe: 1 cup peanut butter 2/3 cup honey 2 eggs Vanilla 2 tbsp oil 1 tsp Baking soda 1/2 c coconut flour Pinch of salt Extra Peanut Butter Melt PB and honey in a microwave safe bowl until melted. Let cool. Mix together eggs, vanilla and oil and add to PB mixture. Fold in baking soda and flour just until blended. Let dough chill for an hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Take a small piece of dough and flatten out. Take a spoonful of peanut butter and place inside of dough. Take another piece of dough and seal in the peanut butter on other half. Continue until no dough is left. (I ended up with about 12 cookies). Press down cookies with a fork and bake for about 10 minutes. Broil for 2. Let cool a bit but serve warm! **You can also do your favourite PB Cookie recipe and add PB to the middle. I just used coconut flour because I'm out of all purpose! But you can't even taste the flour. 2016-01-18 05:29:15 reddit post These are so pretty!

The flavour is very nutty and intense. It's almost like a hazelnut/almond taste and it's definitely An interesting take. 2016-01-16 22:08:22 reddit post Mmmmm that sounds delish 2016-01-16 05:15:30 reddit post You could put peanut butter on a guava and that still would taste good weird but good 2016-01-16 05:14:00 reddit post Water...I like to stay alive. 2016-01-16 05:07:56 reddit post I knew there was something amazing about me 2016-01-16 05:07:28 reddit post That's some high class shit Sometimes I'll eat a tomato like an apple.

Thank you for this comment. That makes me feel better. 2014-06-11 04:57:12 reddit post Don't give up so soon. If there are things you can do to fix your situation I think you should try. I know you don't want to but there's a chance that things will get better and you'll improve. It may take a bit, but if you just stick it out, just think. Everyone is destined for something great, but if you give up now, you may never know. I wish there was something I could do to help other then just give you kind words. If you need anyone to just listen to you, feel free to message me. Update us? Let me know if anything happens or if you start to figure things out. I'd love to talk to you and help you in anyway I can.
