But hey, listen, I could go on and on about myself - Tell you about my hobbies like reading. How I devour novels within hours of buying one. I could tell you how I absolutely love day dreaming, or that I enjoy long, long walks (Sometimes both at the same time.). My favorite style of music? Geek Rock. Not that you'll hear it from me. Or how I was working with a rocking tech company a few months ago, Nerf Wars were one of many office hazards. If I was embarrassed about the fact, I'd probably try to hide the fact I like gaming, video and table top, but if someone were to ask me. I'd probably let them know. You may also hear rumours that I'm a fantastic cook. Not that I'll confirm them, but I'd be lying if I denied them. Haha Maybe I could tell you about how I love watching videos from TED.com, or that I really enjoy listening to comedians as I work? Nah. I'll keep that to myself too. How about the fact that I'm a huge comic book geek, and I enjoy telling people about all the easter eggs in the movie we just watched? No no. I might come off as too nerdy if I told you that! Ohh I know. How about that I love hiking and camping? A good beer, and a campfire is a good night in my book. Hmm... But if I said that, then you might start thinking I was a rugged outdoorsy type. Which I'm not. I just like certain things like that, I don't do them often enough for my liking though. Ok. Well. I guess I'll keep my mouth shut for now. - So yeah. Those are just some of things I wont tell you at the moment. Wouldn't want to waste your time eh? Anyway. If you got through all that, I think I'd like to know about you now.

I've moved to a new city where I haven't made any real connections. Today, out of nowhere I just got crushed by this loneliness on my chest all of a sudden. Like I could physically feel it. Any suggestions? 2015-08-09 01:16:20 reddit post Okay, so a quick run down. I'm new in Toronto. Been here since January. I've made a lot of "friends" people who I enjoy spending time with when I can, and they seem to enjoy my company when we're around. I don't put "friends" in quotes because they're bad people or anything like that. The opposite. The folks I'm referring too are great! But I never get invited out anywhere, and whenever I invite anyone they're often busy. The only time I get any real connection with folks is for dates. I'm really really good with gals. But I've never really met anyone who wants to see me regularly, who seems to want more than something physical with me. And I can't stand anymore fwb situations. I'm intelligent, I'm friendly, I go out of my way to help people whenever I can, and like I say. People seem to love having me around. But clearly there is something awful about me that no one will tell me about so I can fix it. This one girl, who has been my best friend since I moved here, she couldn't even make time for me three weeks ago when my grandfather died. The only person who did was a gal I've been seeing, but I've only gotten like two texts from her since then. TL:DR People don't ever seem to want to spend time with me or ever think about me, and it's been eight months. I'm alone in this city and it's crushing me. Whenever someone says "If you don't have a solution, don't complain" they never give a solution to make the other person want to not complain. 2015-08-08 18:43:28 reddit post First we lose Duke for Sgt Hammer, and now we lose Egon for the Medic?

I'll be working while checking this page, so even if you can only help me with one of the ten, that'd be great. This is the last stretch of my project, and I'm having a wee bit of trouble.

Very simple stuff, I've almost got it all done, I just need to know two different bits of code so I can bring it all together. And of course if you have any extra advice, I'd love to hear it. I want to learn, and become a great web developer. Basically I need to make a page that looks a lot like the one done in the gallery below. You'll see my current version as well. http://imgur.com/a/yXaJz#0 Thank you for your time, even if you only read this. Here is exactly what the project asks for, by the by. "Follow these steps: Search the web for a product of your choice and capture some pictures, product description and features for your project Your page must contain a header, a footer indicating your copyright, a title, a comment line in the header indicating your group number and the student ID and name of all group members. Please use CSS to style your page. The main content area must be separated in two divisions where the left division occupies approximately 1/3 of the content area and shows an image of your product and at least one link to a web site where a visitor to your page can purchase the product. The right hand side of the content area must contain three clickable tabs so when a visitor to your page clicks on any of the tab, the appropriate content shows up. That functionality must be implemented using Javascript and the DOM discussed in the lecture. The third tab must contain a registration form similar to the one shown above. Using Javascript, validate province, postal code, email, password and age. The register now button must show an alert box containing the data entered by the user. Upload your file to the gblearn account of one of group members public_html/comp1231/project. Double check your work by pointing your browser to w5xxxxxx.gblearn.com and clicking at the relevant link."

It. Was. Stellar. We both had an amazing time. We even went to a pride parade, and she thought it was beautiful! She wishes her home country could celebrate like that. So it's not that she's homophobic. But around the end of the date, she found out I was bi. I didn't think it would be a big deal. But now she is concerned that she cannot fulfill me in the way I need, and doesn't want to hold me back. This is a case of her just not understanding how it all works, she's even admitted as much, and I don't hold it against her. And before anyone says "She's just using this as an excuse to cancel" /she/ made the second date before she found out about my sexuality. It would have been easier if I just kept my mouth shut, because if I'm with her, that part of me wouldn't matter. I'm happy to be monogamous with one gender or another. Can anyone give me advice on how to let her know that that is the case? I've tried saying that I wouldn't need that part of me, but she's so unsure. **tl;dr**: Because of cultural differences based on sexual needs. I might be missing out on an amazing and enriching relationship. [Serious] Which meme do you just not understand becoming a meme? (It doesn't need to be purely computer based.

We hit it off, talking about games and the such. We continue going to class, and we joke around, talk all the time. Pretty great pals! Anyway, I think she's cute, but also smart, engaging, fashion forward, and ambitious. So I decide to ask her out, since we get a long so well. She turns me down, and that's that. I'm fine with it to each their own and all that Jazz, don't get pouty or anything, and I try to continue as normal right? But it's several months in and she has been nothing but toxic too me since. Telling me not to talk to her, shooting me dirty looks every time I smile at her or wave, deleting posts from our class room group on facebook(She's the admin) and she made this guy that I got on okay with start to hate me too when they started dating soon after. (The reason she gave me for saying no was that she didn't want to date while going to school, so them dating was an extra slap on the face I guess. But I just took it as she was trying to spare my feelings, so I didn't hold it against her.) I honestly haven't acted any differently since I asked her out. Always behaving just like when we were buddies, and at first I wanted that friendship back, now I just want her to stop being so mean too me, I mean, I'm stuck in class with her for three years. No amount of Dirty looks will change that! **tl;dr**: I asked a girl out, now she hates me. What gives? I clicked the button.

I'm talking with my boss, who is on the other side of the partition while I'm just really giving it to this gravy stain, he leaves to check on a customer. So I'm just standing here, applying some elbow grease and steel wool to the stain, and a woman looks over the partition and we lock eyes, still cleaning I smile at her and continue before turning my eyes away. She later reports me for being obscene. Because she couldn't see me from the waist down. My boss had a good laugh at it, and to this day I hear at least one "Buy that pot some dinner before you clean it today" joke.

Ogmaw had set out with his two Chorts, Zorn, and Xorn. A man of mystery, Ogmaw could disappear without a trace right in front of your eyes. (Hellcat stealth feat.) He brought the brothers on a quest, to prove to the world one thing. Goblins could be heroes too. That's right. Ogmaw Childgutter, our God King. Was a Goblin. A rogue by trade. Master of the Kukuri, Ogmaw could slay any foe. Having a feat of Leadership, he gained first Zorn, then upon a blessing from a magic Gem, Xorn arrived to aid him. For Ogmaw's tale became Mythic. (Champion, Crusader Path Ability. Plus Mythic Leadership.) As Ogmaw gather his allies. A Minor God, Susano, a Child Terror, Kaimusume. (No literally. One shotted an Eldritch Abomination at like level 9. So broken.), the ever loyal Dragon Knight Azai Azreal, Grand Diplomat to the Goblin King, and the treacherous Varion. A summoner of Dubious intent. Ogmaw fought with these brave allies, felling Susanos sister to claim both the Earth and Wind Gem. Wielding the earth Gem, Ogmaw carved a mountain into a castle, and city, he also erected a great wall all around the Nation of Goberian. Soon he had three hundered followers, their wives and husbands, the merchants and other trades people who came to tend to this flock, and his kingdom steadily grew. Welcoming everything from Kobolds to Ogres. Any who wanted a fresh start with a grand society. TL;DR Got a Goblin Rogue in a Mythic Campagin, used leadership to turn it into a mini kingmaker campagin. Took Mythic Ablities to become Immortal and a Divine Source for Clerics. The story of how a Goblin became a God King. (The Goblin word for king is "David Bowie.") I don't want the real answer.

East Coast Canuck looking to Communicate! 2014-09-02 21:15:01 reddit post Hello ladies and Gentlemen. I'm Thomas, pleasure to meet you all. I've decided I want to reach out into the world wide web and chat with some potential new friends. I'd rather this go over email, rather than by address. My hand writing is not exactly well suited for communication. Haha Anyway, I like games, love books, I enjoy to laugh and learn. Ladies or gentlemen, so long as we hit it off I'm fine with chatting. We could learn about one another, share stories, and funny videos. Talk about the latest happenings in our countries and share our views on the political goings on across the globe! What ever strikes our fancy. Now, one rule I'd like to have, that goes for both you and I, one email weekly minimum. Conversations can really lose their steam after much longer than that. Have a lovely day! Oh, I'm also 23, if you're looking to communicate with someone within your own age bracket. LPT: Set different alarm clock tones for each day 2014-09-02 15:03:51 reddit post [removed] Isn't it a waste, that the subscribers are called "MCU Fans" and not True Believers? 2014-09-02 04:27:52 reddit post That seems way more fitting for Marvel With all the NES style retro games, some friends and I thought... 2014-08-29 14:08:22 reddit post http://i.imgur.com/Wq1uMLZ.gif The SNES deserved some love. This system carried more than a few of us through our childhoods, and it had some fantastic art. With more power than the SNES people could get really creative with pushing it to it's limits, and push it they did. Much to the joy of anyone who frequents these communities. In doing what they did, the SNES revolutionized most styles of games. Most notable the Platformer and the RPG. The former, is what my friends and I are working on. An SNES style platformer called "Michelle, Ma Belle". I say friends, but we're really strangers that have come from all corners of the internet, with one goal. To make a game. Hobbiysts doing it for fun, we've got programmers, writers, musicians, and as you can see from the link at the start there, talented artists. It's been a lot of fun so far, and we've just started. We've got a forum if anyone else wants to join (But this isn't a recruitment thread, so if there's interest I'll add our link.), but I wanted to come here, to this bastion of the SNES and ask. "What made the SNES era platformers great?" Our model so far is following mostly the Megaman/Megaman X series of games, but though we're following in the style of the SNES, we're limited only by what our computers can do. So, what features made, and more importantly broke, your favourite platformers? Reddit, let's make a game! Part 2 2014-08-28 19:08:36 reddit post Ok so, this thread was originally over at /r/gamedev but I'm not allowed to recruit over there. That was my mistake. The mods were very nice (LordNed specifically) and he pointed me here. So... here I am, and here's the original post. ---------------------------------------- Hello ladies and gentlemen of Reddit. I am the Creative Director of Thing in a Box Studios. A brand spankin' new hobbyist group where a bunch of amateurs haven gotten together to create games. We started on the Escapist forums because someone said they were bored and wanted to make a game, and I wanted to make sure as many folks who wanted the opportunity to help produce a game, had the chance. So I'll lay it out for you here. We've got Artists We've got Programmers We've got Musicians And we've got Writers And our first game is well underway. (We're planning on an october release date.) So this post is not a "Come do our work for us" kind of thing. It's a "Want to come have fun, learn new things, and help us make a better thing" kind of thing. The game we're working on right now is called "Michelle, Ma Belle" it's about a little girl who needs to use her Shamanic Abilities to stop dark spirits from taking over the world. It's a platformer along the lines of Megaman, when Michelle defeats the enemy Totem Spirits, she gains new power and new forms. (And our sprite artist, Twosage, he is a genie. He's got some amazing SNES style sprites for our use. Michelle is so cute!) Anyway. For those of you that want to learn new things, who might be studying programming and want to practice/have something cool on their portfolio, to those people who want to see their art come to life visually or in audio, and most importantly, to those people who want to have fun, meet new people and make something cool. Come on down. And for people with more experience, that could teach us? We'd love for you to come over, take part, and help us grow. Even if it's just with one post for a list of "Tips" you'd like to give us. We're looking forward to seeing you there. Also, feel free to AMA. Edit: http://w11.zetaboards.com/GameDevExperiment/index/ Forgot the link. HAH! Edit 2: Hey folks. I'm totally ok with it if you want to downvote the thread, that's the whole point of Reddit, to make it so the more interesting things reach the top right? But I'd also love if you'd let me know afterwards what about this thread bugs you. It's the only way I can improve it so I can reach more folks like Azexp, who'd like some practice, or to learn new things. Edit 3: Here's our Github info, and where you can go on our forums to sign up to contribute https://github.com/Ylla-/TotemQuest/ here is the thread where you can ask to contribute. http://w11.zetaboards.com/GameDevExperiment/topic/10491050/4/#new Edit 4: This game is free ware, not commercial. We really are just doing this for fun. And there's not a lot to show yet, as we're early in the project. (We've got a gameplay engine, you can even test it in a prototype stage. On our Github) And we've got story we've worked on, (Which you're welcome to contribute too.) and some of the best sprite work I've seen for a game of this style. I hope to see you all there! Edit 5: For the development section, our members have voted on having it viewable by members only. Just thought I'd give you folks a heads up about that now, since some folks seem to have been upset by being surprised by that fact. Hey Reddit, we're making a freeware game to share with the world! 2014-08-28 18:07:36 reddit post So, this thread is being posted over here, because one fellow "InteractionArtist" invited me to share it with you guys.

[Serious] How do I find out if a part of a song is copyrighted? 2014-08-28 15:42:12 reddit post [removed] Reddit, let's make a game! 2014-08-28 14:15:02 reddit post [removed] Can a level 1 sorcerer, cast level 4 spells and help with a build 2014-08-21 15:35:57 reddit post I'm a Human Sorcerer, for my level 1, I take the favoured class bonus, to take a 4th level spell, Favoured class bonus text - "Add one spell known from the sorcerer spell list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the sorcerer /can/ cast." Rules for a sorcerer to learn and cast a spell - "To learn or /cast/ a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level." My Charisma Score is 20, making my Modifier + 5, which gives me 1 5th level spell per day as per the ability score modifier table. So, I take it that the highest level spell I can cast is 5, because I have 1 per day. Does that mean, with my favoured class bonus, the highest level spell I can learn at the moment is 4th? Alright, so, I prefer to rp with my character, rather than Min Max. I've got this shy little farm girl, 7 wisdom, doesn't know squat about the world. Suddenly, comes into her own as a sorcerer do to ancient blood. What I'd love to do, is have three bloodlines in her. Via Cross Blooded and the Eldricth heritage feats. One stipulation is, I want her to have the "Impossible" blood line, as one of hers. She's going to be an item crafter. What are two other blood lines that I should go for? What would be some good spells and feats? Traits? (I'm probably going to go with the traits that make it cheaper for me to make things, and I'm going to make a ton of wands, because I've never used wands. Any tips on those too?) I'm starting at level one, so I don't need the whole build. Just a good starting point. OH! And the DM is totally open to fair homebrew stuff, and 3rd party material. No guns. Not that I want to use any anyway. lol Thanks for your help Reddit! EDIT: Ok, so I've got that sorted out, thanks to some very knowledgable people. Now, can anyone suggest a good build for me to work on? Starting at level 1 with the Impossible Bloodline.

Keep in mind I know little to no Slang. And even less about the system. Reading the book as we speak.

We primarily instituted tags in season 1 so as to separate spoilers from the book, but now that season 1 basically covered the book, the rule no longer feels necessary. Many users encountered troubles with the tagging system, and we feel the frustration the system caused submitters outweighed the benefit some users gained from being able to browse with specific spoiler scopes. All we ask now is that you abstain from putting spoilers in the title. You should now expect spoilers up to the latest aired episode in any links or comments posted here, unless the title specifically says otherwise (such as a user with a season 1 question, or an official episode discussion). Also keep in mind that episode previews and information from IMDB (such as the number of episodes a character appears in) is considered to be a spoiler and should be tagged appropriately.

subject350 Cloud porn over London this morning. 2013-12-22 15:23:38 reddit post 2013-12-22 14:24:32 reddit post Gee.. thanks for the tip, growlers sounds good. Our first Christmas in Europe! 2013-12-22 14:22:01 reddit post Hello Redditors, Wife and I have been together for 11 years now, we have just recently moved to the UK because we always wanted to do live in London and wanted to travel Europe properly. Been here 6 months now and have been taking time out to visit nearby countries and the English countryside. It has been a dream come true, really. We are going to Berlin on Tuesday for 5 nights so we'll be there on the 25th December. My wife loves all things Christmas and has been wanting to see Berlin for years... so Berlin at this time of the year was an obvious choice given the Christmas markets. So since we are going to be in Berlin and at her favourite time of the year I just want to make it that extra bit special by doing something super romantic besides just taking her out for a nice dinner. Additionally, I'm hoping places will be open during the Christmas time and we'll be able to explore the city and have some fun. I've heard 24th is the BIG day and 25th is relatively "normal". Thoughts please? Are there any Berliners around here who could help me with some options and tips. We both like to immerse ourselves in the local culture, we LOVE food, looking forward to the Christmas cheer (or whatever is left of it by then!) and enjoy the little things in life. My budget is approx 100 Euros for the night, if that helps. We are staying in Mitte and will be there for 5 nights. tl;dr - couple in Christmas looking for tips of things to do and make a special night out of. 2013-12-22 14:10:53 reddit post Sorry, new to Reddit! Will post in Berlin. Thanks. We need this in pubs all over the world.

Resorting to mixing with your own kind is arguably not the best use of your effort to move countries. Might as well just stay put. I've noticed this amongst most cultures although Westerners more propensity to mix in general than people from developing countries. This broad brush analysis is based on my experience of living in 3 countries over the last 10 years. 2013-12-10 18:45:10 reddit post Also makes me hungry and wantbto eat bacon all the time.

subject366 2013-04-20 06:17:46 reddit post The thing about finding people to test is that I require honesty, so typically I ask close friends and people I know professionally. I respect the opinion of a small number of very experienced people over 100 noobs. In fact, the reviews of most vibrators are almost all 5 stars. It isn't hard to give a mediocre vibrator a great review if it is your first one. Vibrators are like bacon, even a bad one is still pretty great. 2013-04-20 06:02:08 reddit post Hi, I would like to get on the calendar on Tuesday April 23rd at 9:30 PM EST.

I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. In our office, it would be no big deal. It can be difficult to find a company that will work with you though because some folks are afraid to put adult products into their work environment. We had a difficult time finding a company to make us lollipops for Bachelorette.com. 2013-04-20 05:39:08 reddit post I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. There is a company that makes wood toys, but I'm not a fan of the material because it can harbor bacteria. They are called Nob Essence (nob, ha!) 2013-04-20 05:36:42 reddit post I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. I've met the folks at TSX, they are very nice people who understand that most of what they make is novelty items. They are really sweet people though. I've know about Bad-Dragon but I have never met anyone from the company. Their site creeps me out a little bit and I'm pretty thick-skinned. 2013-04-20 05:35:05 reddit post Thanks for writing. Women do much of the sculpting. Most I've worked with are not supermodels. They use the protoypes to make production molds. It isn't really as sexy as it sounds. Most new items aren't really ground breaking. There are thousands of different products in the marketplace. 2013-04-20 05:33:39 reddit post I'll see if we can encode a better quality one. Thanks for the compliment and the advice. 2013-04-20 05:33:01 reddit post I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. I'll try to answer it all: Yes. Yes. There are many wireless toys on the market. There is even one that sells on our site for less than $20. http://www.vibrators.com/waterproof-remote-control-bullet.html None of them have any security measures built in. I'm not sure the customer cares. What harm would it cause if one of them were hacked? Drained batteries? There are trade shows were manufacturers meet with retailers, etc. It is a weird business. It is sorta fun too. Thanks for asking. 2013-04-20 05:30:27 reddit post I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. I am going to schedule an AMA soon. I'm still sorta figuring it all out. 2013-04-20 05:30:03 reddit post I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. I'm more of a vibrationist. 2013-04-20 05:29:44 reddit post I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. Bad-Dragon.com is sure an interesting company. 2013-04-20 05:28:50 reddit post I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. The designs end up fairly easy to smooth out. Also, as the printer resolutions get better, the same digital design will produce a smoother product. Thanks for writing. 2013-04-20 05:28:08 reddit post I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. There is no way out of this business. Once you entered our industry, you could never find work anywhere else. You would do better to try to get experience elsewhere and then enter the adult products business as the boss of a company. I hope that is good advice. 2013-04-20 05:27:03 reddit post I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out. I started an online store that sold embarrassing drugstore items in 1998. ShopInPrivate.com launched about 6 months prior to any other online drugstores and was sorta successful. We promised total privacy and people used that privacy to buy sex toys. Soon thereafter Drugstore.com, CVS.com and Walgreens.com launched and we had to make money, so we were happy to privately sell sex toys. Eventually we acquired the Vibrators.com business and we also own Bachelorette.com (bachelorette party supplies).

They do, although I don't think they are a major player in the industry. 2013-04-20 05:23:35 reddit post Thanks for the offer. Sorry I took so long to reply. I wasn't up to speed on Reddit. 2013-04-20 05:23:09 reddit post I apologize for taking so long to reply. You are very welcome. 2013-04-20 05:21:00 reddit post First, I apologize for taking a long time to answer you question. Here goes.. Dildos are generally thicker than vibrators because dildos are purchased to feel penetration. Women (and men) who want vibration don't usually need the thickness. There are exceptions to this, but in general dildos are sold thicker and with deeper ridges than vibes. It sounds like you might actually enjoy a realistic vibrator more. http://www.vibrators.com/real.html Personally, I don't understand why people don't buy more vibrators and fewer dildos, but you some folks like the term dildo, like person who started this thread. He could have called it Vibrator Engineer. Finally, Silicone is the current material of choice for well-researched individuals due to its lack of porosity and ease of keeping sanitary. They make a couple of squirting dildos. http://www.vibrators.com/squirtingdildo.html 2013-04-20 05:16:36 reddit post First, I apologize for taking a long time to answer you question. Here goes This is me: If I were lying, I would pick someone more handsome. http://www.priveco.com/tomnarpresis.html tom@priveco.com 2013-04-20 05:15:52 reddit post First, I apologize for taking a long time to answer you question. Here goes Most toys are still sculpted in clay and then cast from there. Sometimes they use a live person, but even those molds are worked over, especially the female ones. 2013-04-20 05:11:50 reddit post First, I apologize for taking a long time to answer you question. Here goes: I think the industry is shrinking away from highly controllable motors because the customer has largely ignored them. Customers don't seem to enjoy a large number of functions, nor programability. Also, when using an adult toy, there is very little way to see what you are doing. The controls need to be operable blind. Companies are moving back toward keeping it simple and i think we will find a continued push toward this. Companies like Smitten Kitten and other boutique retailers are more a reaction of the changing gender of the buyers over the last 20 years. Women now buy the toys and they aren't afraid to spend a large amount on them. Retailers with a female bent have sprouted up to fill the need. I'm not aware of any wireless standards for the wireless toys. I suspect that the manufacturers of such just piggyback off of some other existing technologies. I suppose we will continue to see that in the future. I doubt anyone will find some great need in sex toys which will require a unified wireless standard. Mostly, they are just turned on and off. 2013-01-30 06:21:27 reddit post IAMA Dildo/Vibrators Engineer. My name is Tom Nardone and I run subject366 Inc. We own and operate Vibrators.com. In the past I worked for Sikorsky Aircraft a helicopter company as well as Ford Motor Company. You can find out more about me at subject366.com. Here are your answers: 1. Most dildo molds have been around a while. Early ones were usually cast from clay sculptures, but some were made from famous dudes' junk. These days prototypes are done on 3D printers and then the molds are made from there. 2. I usually don't lead with my profession, but I don't lie about it either. It doesn't hurt that I own the company, so I've been fairly successful. It would be tough to explain why I did what I do if it didn't pay well. 3. Dildos and vibrators materials have come a long way. Silicone is really popular these days because it is the safest materials, but dildos are made from latex rubber, elastomers, glass, pyrex, ABS plastic, wood, stainless steel. You name it. 4. There is a company out there called TSX (I believe) that makes all sorts of animal dildos and stuff. They make the weirdest things I've ever seen. Giant stuff like horse dongs. 5. Dildo designers usually do pocket pussies and artificial vaginas as well. Fleshlight is one brand of those. What does the future hold? We are all working with 3D printers to do prototypes now, and when they are available in peoples' homes, I imagine that people will print their own sex toys. MakerLove.com is a project that a couple of people are working on to provide free dildo designs for your 3D printer. There you go.

I don't have a source for that, it's just something I picked up somewhere and don't really know how to verify. Regardless, the more moving parts, the more possibility of a part failure.

To get laughter, they'd play pre-taped episodes for an audience. If you want a show that NEVER used an audience, look no further than ALF. The format of the show (the ALF puppet was prone to frequent malfunctions, and had to placed in specially made trap doors so the puppeteer could operate it) meant that taping in front of a live audience would've been severely impractical, as scenes as simple as ALF talking to someone might require as much as 15 takes just to get right. Because of this, all laughter was insert during planned pauses during audio post. 2015-09-05 06:45:02 reddit post Baking Bad is a Family Guy episode, and well, the character of Joe is in it.

Personally I think it was consistently funny up until season 6 or 7 or so, then it began to fumble a bit by season 10, and now it's just wildly hit-and-miss, with the worst episodes ("The Hobbit"/"World War Zimmerman") being borderline unwatchable. 2015-08-28 16:44:36 reddit post They made Stan a fuckin moron last season. Like that subplot where he makes people invisible by snapping, what the hell was that? 2015-08-28 16:41:29 reddit post Nope. It was canned after season 2 but the decision was reversed last-minute. Then, after season 3, it was canned for good, but Adult Swim reruns and DVDs were doing so well they brought it back, and it hasn't been canned again. 2015-08-27 23:33:06 reddit post I want to be happy about this, but the TBS season was a marked decline over the FOX seasons. There was just a continuous feel of staleness throughout the entire thing. I'll wait to see if the next season is good before getting excited about this 2015-08-27 09:09:59 reddit post Agree.

Turn off the TV if there's gunman coverage!" Seems like he doesn't. 2015-08-25 22:42:32 reddit post I liked Cinema Sins until they made all their videos 20+ minutes. Watching a video that long that's ENTIRELY nitpicks is just tiring. And the videos used to have a jokey, non-serious vibe, but now they're fully committed tojust nitpicking seriously. There are occasional good jokes/observations but it just gets tiring. 2015-08-25 18:37:46 reddit post I'm not comfortable to fully say that. I think Summit and Lionsgate are just bad at marketing. Their movie Child 44 was based on a book and also bombed like crazy. 2015-08-25 18:20:54 reddit post Yeah, Landis isn't being very objective here. To paraphrase: "American Ultra is, honestly, a good movie. The fact that it bombed obviously means the end of original ideas as we know it." Uh, let's see. It tried to market Kristen Stewart to an audience generally against Kristen Stewart (and what box office credence does she have outside of Twilight - which was already established and didn't depend on her?) and Eisenberg is pretty hit and miss fo most people. It got rather poor reviews. The marketing was pretty sparse. These all seem like legitimate reasons for a movie to fail. So what if your movie has "big stars, a fun idea, and honestly, [was] a good movie..." (his words)? All the above factors seem like reasons a movie would bomb. There's very little here that has ANY sort of draw. I definitely believe he's shifting the blame a bit. 2015-08-25 18:14:35 reddit post yet it bombed because horror fans will go see any kind of crap and because more marketing was put behind Hitman. This doesn't seem to be comparable to "original ideas don't make bank!" though. I think the piss marketing for this movie did it in. Didn't even know it existed until I saw a preview for it at the theater... like two days ago. (And I don't want to see it because it looks bad.) 2015-08-25 17:42:04 reddit post Kaydyn is an orgy of letters. No two Ys should ever be that close, and the fact that the second Y is a substitute (the Y DIDN'T NEED TO BE THERE) is inexcusable. Michael sounds nice and the letters all go together moderately well. I'm a sucker for "ae"s, one of the better looking letter combination in this English language of ours. But if you're a Kaydyn fan, it's OK! We still have people trying to ruin it by pulling a Kaydyn and sticking a Y in there (looking at YOU, Mychael Danna). 2015-08-25 08:11:32 reddit post The Simpsons as a whole is monstrously influential. It may have gotten bad, but the influence it had (and the phenomenal first eight or so seadons) is still active today. It's earned its stripes. Rick and Morty never would've existed without The Simpsons, and it is unlikely that it will have even a quarter of an impact The Simpsons did. 2015-08-25 08:08:18 reddit post Why? Why can't a new show be fucking awesome and worthy of acclaim until proven shitty in a later season? e.g. Lost, Dexter. A show in its first season is still growing. These high ratings are not represantive of a GREAT SHOW, just a first season that turned out to be really good. Whereas with shows like The Simpsons, the entire show has been scrutinized and ends up with an 8, because this is something that can be accurately judged. Rick and Morty being so high is a circlejerky embarassment. It has one season and a second season is currently airing. All that can be judged is a show that's still brand new and still growing. 2015-08-24 23:25:10 reddit post It still shows up, but it never gets far. 2015-08-24 23:06:27 reddit post Around two years ago it was almost inescapable. 2015-08-24 22:26:22 reddit post That sort of clashes with the TIL rules which state not to repost TILs that have made it high up in the past. 2015-08-24 20:04:14 reddit post You have a legitimate point. I feel that even though it is likely someone will see a heavily-reposted TIL for the first time on the 72548th repost, it doesn't justify regurgitating unoriginal TILs tons of times. 2015-08-24 20:02:08 reddit post FWIW I haven't defended piracy, so it's not the same people. 2015-08-24 20:00:35 reddit post Oh come on, I never said anything about being MAJORLY distressed by a repost. I just think it's irritating, because I've seen this way more than twice. 2015-08-24 19:16:08 reddit post Well, you might as well post it here now. ;'| 2015-08-24 19:08:13 reddit post I know this always comes up. "I wouldn't have seen it if this wasn't reposted." But seriously? There's a possibility someone out there hasn't seen the Steve Buscemi 9/11 firefighter TIL... doesn't mean it's not an unoriginal and oversaturated thing to post. I think there should be a limit to how many times a TIL can be posted, because, hell, even posting the same TIL every day might result in someone seeing it for the first time after the 3rd day. 2015-08-24 09:01:42 reddit post Whenever movies that just came out are brought up in recent threads, Man from UNCLE is seemingly always mentioned as being an Overlooked Gem that you should Totally See to fight the studios.

For reference, I started my IMDB account in May 1999, and I recently had a conversation with a guy who was born in May 2001. This guy, who is fully lucid and can make concious decisions, is younger than my fucking IMDB account, what the fuck. 2015-08-22 01:48:13 reddit post Yeah, I agree. I think Dewey Cox is decent but it meanders a bit and wears out its welcome by the end (the arduous extended cut isn't any better). I WANTED to discuss that aspect of the movie, but nope, it's just people regurgitating "the wrong kid died" over and over. 2015-08-21 16:00:04 reddit post ...what was the meaning before? 2015-08-21 03:32:14 reddit post Not negative... it's just probably the reason why it's not getting tons of upvotes. 2015-08-21 01:23:57 reddit post Because it's not a very original thought and has been in EVERY thread related to AM? 2015-08-20 16:44:53 reddit post Looks like it got deleted though before it got very far.

Are there really that many that never had actual audiences? I'd imagine the actual number has tapered off in recent years, because really the only multi-cam sitcoms with laugh tracks airing today are Chuck Lorre shows, and those are all filmed live with audiences. 2015-08-17 19:03:07 reddit post Uh... like? 2015-08-16 21:37:16 reddit post At least most of the comments are callin OP out for his BS 2015-08-16 17:49:42 reddit post One of the replies to that comment is Alec Sokolow (who co-wrote both Garf movies) calling Bill Murray out for lying. cedric the entertainer/sally struthers sex tape leaked 2015-08-16 04:10:16 reddit post yes Straight Outta Compton: Universal offers to reimburse theaters for extra security 2015-08-13 03:09:50 reddit post Man in minion costume gets what he deserves 2015-08-10 04:41:48 reddit post Chris Farley version of Shrek leaked 2015-08-06 02:40:14 reddit post minion gets owned 2015-07-19 04:11:06 reddit post

It would be pretty awesome if Clinton somehow eked out a win there in amongst a sea of red states. 2016-11-03 20:08:21 reddit post Thank God - that's a major win against the Trump Intimidation Squad. 2016-11-03 17:31:35 reddit post Phew! *Breathes huge sigh of relief* 2016-11-03 17:23:04 reddit post Damn, that's a huge number for the final World Series game. I'm very happy for the Cubs and their fans. :) The CMA Awards did very well considering the enormous competition - ABC must be happy. Series-low number for Survivor, but that has to be expected since it was airing against two hugely watched events. It should probably have a big recovery next week. 2016-11-03 13:26:15 reddit post Wow, I would so love it if Clinton somehow wins both of those states by 15-20 points in the end. The Trump campaign would be absolutely dumbfounded. 2016-11-03 01:52:39 reddit post This one showing Hillary leading nationally by 8 points: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKBN12X2P6 2016-11-03 01:39:56 reddit post As Tuco once said: "Tight, tight, tight." But I think Hillary will one this one in the end. 2016-11-03 01:18:49 reddit post Trumpsters and those from /r/The_Donald are downvoting this thread since the poll aggregators and many state polls in key swing states still show Clinton leading over The Orange One (and with a vastly greater chance of winning) despite the FBI e-mail investigation and Wikileaks. You should have seen the poll megathread from 3 days ago when it was downvoted to 0 points. The amount of butthurt and delusion on display is truly astounding. 2016-11-03 01:15:06 reddit post That latest Reuters/Ipsos poll has me feeling really hopeful about stopping The Orange One. I will sleep soundly tonight. :) 2016-11-03 00:23:10 reddit post Niiiiiiiiice. 2016-11-02 23:52:08 reddit post Lol, why you mad tho? 2016-11-02 22:52:09 reddit post Noooooooooope. 2016-11-02 22:24:31 reddit post So will the mainstream media (CNN, Fox News, etc.) be showing the press conference for this live? I sure hope so. 2016-11-02 17:10:20 reddit post Still terrific for This Is Us - even against the ratings behemoth that is The World Series! NBC must be ecstatic right now. Too bad about The Flash reaching a series-low - it should recover with its next episode most likely. Glad to see Agents of SHIELD remain steady. :) 2016-11-02 03:41:56 reddit post http://imgur.com/7drHiqr?r 2016-11-02 03:28:18 reddit post I'm really glad Timeless is getting a full season - hopefully the creators give it a satisfying ending just in case it doesn't get renewed. 2016-11-02 01:29:16 reddit post Niiiiiiiiiice. 2016-11-01 20:15:30 reddit post http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=mobilebar v=1 2016-11-01 17:12:16 reddit post Oof, bad night for a lot of shows. I'm guessing that trick-or-treating and Halloween parties had a significant effect? Here's hoping that Timeless and Supergirl recover next week. 2016-11-01 15:13:02 reddit post The poll source link is in the article and is a highly-rated pollster (rated B+ by 538) and has been pretty accurate in the past. I'm just following the subreddit rules, folks. :) 2016-10-31 20:12:32 reddit post Regarding Jason Statham, I just wish Lionsgate would make Crank 3 already. The first two movies were a fucking blast. 2016-10-31 20:09:49 reddit post It's going to be big - I'll go with a $80 million opening weekend and strong legs. 2016-10-31 17:36:57 reddit post New series-low for Quantico - wow. I'm pretty sure it's going to be cancelled, even though it does have high Live +7 ratings. Huge for The World Series as usual. 2016-10-30 20:06:56 reddit post Yep, it's pretty great. It's often pretty terrifying, with some excellent cinematography and acting as well. 2016-10-30 18:32:04 reddit post Lol, no. 2016-10-30 17:14:34 reddit post Final weekend estimates per Deadline: Top 11 films per studio-reported figures for the weekend of Oct. 28-30: 1).

I'm guessing they're relieved it's already made bank overseas. Great second weekend for Boo! A Madea Halloween - best second weekend drop ever for a Madea film. Very impressive. 2016-10-30 02:52:41 reddit post The reprise of last season's "I Could If I Wanted To" was especially wonderful in this episode. 2016-10-30 00:54:58 reddit post Be sure to join us at /r/crazyexgirlfriend for weekly episode discussions. 2016-10-29 22:11:45 reddit post Really? Well, hooray! :) 2016-10-29 22:03:54 reddit post I'm just glad that Crazy Ex-Girlfriend stayed steady - especially against The World Series. It dipped in total viewers, predictably so against the baseball behemoth. Hopefully it recovers next week. *Crosses fingers* Great for The World Series as usual - tonight's game should be big as well. 2016-10-29 18:14:43 reddit post Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in a musical that's getting amazing reviews? I'm sold. I think it will do pretty well - maybe it will bring in some of the same audience that made Crazy, Stupid, Love. a hit (they had incredible chemistry in that film as well). 2016-10-29 17:26:14 reddit post It's still pretty crazy that it's making less than half of what Angels and Demons made in 2009, but that's what happens when you release a sequel seven years too late, I guess. 2016-10-29 17:09:41 reddit post Ouch, that's really terrible for Inferno. I guess Sony should be slightly relieved that it wasn't enormously expensive, and at least it's doing much better overseas for them. 2016-10-29 00:35:36 reddit post They're fucking amazing. 2016-10-29 00:34:10 reddit post Any bets on what the RCP poll average will be by Tuesday, guys? 2016-10-29 00:16:02 reddit post So when will the first polls that include the fallout from this factored in come out?

No wonder he's polling at 1% among African-Americans in Pennsylvania (my home state). 2016-10-28 21:08:53 reddit post Clinton camp, you can go ahead and release the Trump N-word tape from The Apprentice any time now... 2016-10-28 18:10:13 reddit post It's very nice to see both Superstore and The Good Place both rise from last week's numbers. :) Hopefully they adjust up or stay steady when final numbers come out. 2016-10-28 16:08:35 reddit post So is anybody else here besides me super excited to see Doctor Strange next weekend? It's getting some terrific reviews, and it currently has the highest Rotten Tomatoes score of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films (96%). 2016-10-28 02:52:19 reddit post ADAM SCOTT! 2016-10-28 02:48:21 reddit post The lie detector cube is super cute and hilarious. 2016-10-27 23:21:50 reddit post Those Live +7 ratings for Timeless, The Good Place, and Agents of SHIELD give me hope that we may see an additional season of all three shows . Here's hoping that NBC and ABC take these numbers into account when deciding whether or not to renew them! 2016-10-27 23:15:16 reddit post Hopefully it recovers next week. *Crosses fingers* I wouldn't worry too much - it's already received a full season order, and it's a fucking BEAST in Live+7 ratings. I think ABC is pretty damn happy, especially considering it's in a 10 pm slot on ABC (where many shows have flat-out bombed), and it's doing far better in that time slot than its shows in the past. 2016-10-27 02:51:27 reddit post Well, fuck! Man, I hope that this is good. 2016-10-27 02:16:45 reddit post Daaaaaaaamn. 2016-10-26 23:30:16 reddit post Niiiiiiiiice. 2016-10-26 18:15:49 reddit post Terrific number for The World Series game - FOX must be really happy.

I'm glad to see The Flash and Agents of SHIELD hold steady. :) 2016-10-26 16:01:39 reddit post /r/shield 2016-10-25 18:13:00 reddit post Timeless is still falling hard in its second hour - falling from a 1.6 in its first half to a 1.2 in its second. Things aren't looking great for it, unfortunately, and NBC still hasn't ordered a back-nine. I think the chances of a second season at this point are slim-to-none, which is too bad because I like the show. :( 2016-10-24 18:32:46 reddit post Double dumbass on you! 2016-10-24 18:26:51 reddit post Bye bye, Quantico! 2016-10-23 23:12:13 reddit post Damn, dude is the Nostradamus of our times. 2016-10-23 20:57:41 reddit post Superb number for Madea - look at that per theater average ($12,212). Very impressive. Solid enough numbers for both Jack Reacher and Ouija - I imagine that they will both hold well next weekend. The Accountant had a pretty nice drop, too - shows that audiences are really liking it. 2016-10-23 19:57:17 reddit post I'm going to go with 15.5 million viewers, 7.1 18-49 demo rating. 2016-10-23 13:11:17 reddit post Counterpoint: I honestly thought it was a blast (Stanley Tucci and Tommy Lee Jones are both amazing in it, and Joe Johnston did a great job with the film). 2016-10-22 19:50:41 reddit post Bad news, guys - this show premiered to a series-low 0.2 18-49 rating and only 539,000 viewers. :( Let's hope that the critical acclaim and award wins mean something to The CW so that we can get a third season. Also, it was up against the Hamilton documentary on PBS last night (which probably did pretty well, considering it was the #1 trending topic on Twitter when it was airing). I hope the ratings either rise or stay steady in the weeks to come. 2016-10-22 19:42:50 reddit post Damn, that's a really impressive number for Madea. 2016-10-22 19:37:36 reddit post Noooooooooooo! Damn, that's disappointing. Hopefully, it will increase in weeks to come, or The CW will say "Fuck the ratings!" and keep it airing due to the critical acclaim/awards factor. 2016-10-22 19:25:04 reddit post I'm very sad to see Crazy Ex-Girlfriend open lower (only 539,000 viewers? Ouch). It's my favorite show, and I was hoping for a third season. :( Here's hoping that with the Netflix deal and the unique nature of The CW that it will get another season - especially with all of the critical acclaim it receives and its Emmy/Golden Globe wins. 2016-10-22 18:53:16 reddit post This fucking sucks - hope Fox hires on a good director with a love for the source material (and who works well with Ryan Reynolds)! 2016-10-22 17:45:24 reddit post I'm very sad to see Crazy Ex-Girlfriend open lower - it's my favorite show, and I was hoping for a third season. :( Here'a hoping that with the Netflix deal and the unique nature of The CW that it will. The Exorcist received its best ratings since the pilot - people are really liking it, so maybe there's a small chance it will get a second season. 2016-10-22 17:31:28 reddit post Damn, this fucking sucks. 2016-10-22 16:04:35 reddit post This is exciting news. More Adam Scott is always a good thing. 2016-10-22 14:34:12 reddit post *High-fives you* That's forking awesome. 2016-10-22 14:16:52 reddit post Relevant username - nice!

Sad to see The Good Place and Superstore so low. I can't believe the former has already gone fractional since it's so fucking good. :( Hopefully they both recover next week. *Crosses fingers* 2016-10-21 05:08:36 reddit post Agreed - this is going to be big. 2016-10-21 03:01:00 reddit post OH, SHIT!

Way different than I expected. 2016-10-20 03:34:56 reddit post WRONG! 2016-10-20 03:33:24 reddit post Well, here's the shitshow that we were all waiting for. 2016-10-20 03:31:59 reddit post You're the puppet! Lol 2016-10-19 18:27:37 reddit post Damn, This Is Us is a beast - beating The Voice once again! Sad to see Agents of SHIELD reach a series-low - I hope that ABC gives it a fifth and final season, much like Fox did with Fringe. 2016-10-18 18:13:40 reddit post Yayyy, Timeless is steady! Unfortunately, it dropped from a 1.8 in the first half-hour to a 1.3 in the second. Who knows how it will perform next year without The Voice lead-in? If it averaged around a 1.3-1.4 next year, I think NBC might be happy (it looks like a pretty expensive show, though). Very good number for Supergirl - it didn't drop too much from the premiere. I'm sure that The CW is happy. And, hey, at least Jane the Virgin matched last season's premiere. 2016-10-18 01:30:10 reddit post Considering that Deepwater Horizon had an estimated $110 million budget (with probably a $30-40 million marketing budget), and it'll probably end up at $60-65 million domestic...yeah, it's definitely a huge bomb for Lionsgate. Heads are going to roll for this one. 2016-10-17 22:58:53 reddit post Why, God, why? 2016-10-17 22:56:58 reddit post Be sure to join us at /r/crazyexgirlfriend for weekly episode discussions. 2016-10-17 22:53:09 reddit post wat 2016-10-17 18:19:11 reddit post Great number for The Simpsons (thanks, NFL lead-in!). Rough night for ABC - it's looking likely that this will be the final season of both Quantico (which has now gone fractional) and Secrets and Lies. 2016-10-17 16:06:27 reddit post The movie was PG-13, actually. 2016-10-17 15:10:48 reddit post Yep, I have a feeling that Moonlight and Fences are going to get a lot of Oscar nominations instead in order to avoid the "Oscars So White" criticism from last year. 2016-10-17 03:36:55 reddit post Donald Trump 2016-10-17 03:36:33 reddit post TV Tropes 2016-10-16 04:41:20 reddit post It's in its 12th season now, and it sounds like they want to get to at least episode 300 (which would be in Season 14). 2016-10-16 02:29:03 reddit post I'm just hoping that the terrific Crazy Ex-Girlfriend does OK when it returns next Friday. *Crosses fingers* 2016-10-15 18:51:00 reddit post Very good number for The Accountant - I definitely wasn't expecting it to do $20 million+ 2016-10-14 18:27:48 reddit post Supernatural continues to remain incredibly steady - it's still a lot of fun. I'm catching up with last season on Netflix now. Too bad about Legends of Tomorrow - maybe the villain from last season drew some viewers away? I don't watch it (but plan to), but I heard numerous people complaining about him. Pitch and Rosewood are goners. At least you have Empire and Lethal Weapon, Fox! 2016-10-14 18:18:01 reddit post Supernatural will continue until the heat death of the universe. Its fanbase is insanely supportive, and they have stuck with it despite its many time slot changes over the seasons. Its ratings have remained steady as a rock. 2016-10-13 18:34:04 reddit post Lol, good catch! The writer should have really done the research first. 2016-10-13 18:27:57 reddit post Lethal Weapon's performance has been really impressive - I'm sure Fox is happy to have a solid hit. ABC's comedy block remains incredibly solid. Survivor continues to be the sturdiest reality show on TV - much like Supernatural, NCIS, Grey's Anatomy, and Law Order: SVU, it should continue for many more seasons. Nice to see Designated Survivor remain steady. I hope Frequency doesn't drop any further. 2016-10-13 04:36:02 reddit post So...Clinton goes up another 5-10 points in the polls in the next few days? I'm OK with this. 2016-10-13 03:47:23 reddit post So if Clinton's lead over Trump in the polls gets even higher (say up to 15-20 points) before Election Day, will even more Republicans jump ship? Man, I hope so. 2016-10-12 21:10:04 reddit post Runaways on Hulu (based on the comic book series) 2016-10-12 18:54:05 reddit post Fuck, yes, it is. The show takes you on a roller coaster, and it's incredibly fun. 2016-10-12 18:29:40 reddit post *cough* Nate Parker *cough* 2016-10-12 18:22:03 reddit post Damn, people really love the shit out of This Is Us. NBC must be ecstatic to have a huge drama hit that's actually increasing from its lead-in. Chicago Fire did great as well. Good night for ABC's comedy block - everything did very solid. Sad to see Agents of SHIELD go fractional, but that's not surprising. Rough night for FOX - EVERYTHING is fractional! Even though that's a series-low for The Flash, that's still a good number. No Tomorrow is DOA, though - it will be interesting to see if The CW renews everything last season or if they cancel some shows. 2016-10-11 23:27:26 reddit post Nope. Nate Parker is an awful human being, so I'm not surprised. 2016-10-11 18:22:15 reddit post That's a very good debut for Supergirl. I hope this bodes well for the return of the wonderful Crazy Ex-Girlfriend on October 21st. The CW has so many quality shows these days, so it's nice to see them performing well. Be sure to join us at /r/TelevisionRatings for more excellent ratings discussion and analysis as well. 2016-10-11 18:19:38 reddit post This is incredibly disappointing and disturbing news, especially since I was always a fan of Devin's writing since his CHUD days (he was always controversial in his very outspoken views). I will continue to read the site, though, since they have some great writers (like Meredith Borders and Brian Collins). 2016-10-11 18:16:18 reddit post Very good start for Supergirl - I'm sure that The CW is very happy. Hopefully Timeless settles around a 1.3-1.4 - I think it's pretty fun so far. 2016-10-11 05:49:38 reddit post Source? 2016-10-11 04:44:53 reddit post Nope, I think Tina Fey wanted 30 Rock to be Home Improvement in terms of the huge ratings it got, which it never did. 2016-10-11 03:00:47 reddit post Be sure to join us at /r/The_Exorcist for weekly episode discussions. 2016-10-10 21:52:07 reddit post Huge (as expected) numbers for the second debate. 2016-10-10 18:29:01 reddit post Daaaaaamn. 2016-10-10 03:43:28 reddit post EXTREEEEEEMEE VETTING 2016-10-10 02:52:22 reddit post Oh, boy. 2016-10-09 20:48:59 reddit post Wow, Birth of a Nation did very poorly.

I can't wait for Monday to see more Republicans jump off the Trump ship. 2016-10-09 15:31:15 reddit post Niiiiiiiice.

It would be amazing if it's tonight before the debate. 2016-10-09 05:45:15 reddit post Wow at MacGyver's quick demise - it is pretty likely to get cancelled now, I think. Poor The Exorcist - it's so damn good. I wish Fox would move it to F/X or something, or some other network would pick it up after they inevitably cancel it. 2016-10-08 23:40:07 reddit post Trump is cancelling his rally tonight, according to CNN.

The last episode received a 0.6 18-49 rating, which is terrible for a show on a broadcast network. At least we'll get 13 well-made episodes, hopefully. 2016-10-08 06:11:35 reddit post What a shitty fucking apology that was. 2016-10-08 04:30:51 reddit post We can only hope. *Crosses fingers* 2016-10-08 04:02:54 reddit post They're seriously taking about the possibility of Trump dropping out right now on MSNBC.

Lol 2016-10-08 00:38:02 reddit post CNN just reported that Bush's campaign manager said, "This is disgusting. I'm voting for Trump." It's going to be beautiful to see how many Republicans jump off the Trump bandwagon now. 2016-10-08 00:21:20 reddit post This story is at the very top of CNN.com now, and all of the profanity including "fuck" and "pussy" is UN-EDITED. I've never seen that before. Wow. Can Trump really be done after this? 2016-10-08 00:12:25 reddit post I love how this story is now the #2 trending story on the Apple News app - these remarks are being shown everywhere except for Fox News, I guess. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this event alone (along with Trump's probable disastrous debate tomorrow) makes Clinton go up another 2-5 points in the polls nationally (where she is already up an average of 4-5 points nationally). Trump, I think you're fucked. 2016-10-08 00:03:42 reddit post I love how this story is now the #2 trending story on the Apple News app - these remarks are being shown everywhere except for Fox News, I guess.

I imagine that if it maintains around a 0.4 average, it will probably be renewed, especially since The CW renewed their entire slate of shows last season - even the extremely low-rated - but wonderful - Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. 2016-10-06 18:21:45 reddit post I wish that Frequency had premiered better - I hear it's quite good, and I plan on checking it out. The movie it's based on is one of my favorites. Empire is really falling fast - this was almost a series-low. Hopefully Designated Survivor recovers next week - it will surely do great in the Live+3 and Live+7 ratings, though. 2016-10-06 16:04:17 reddit post Hmm...that does sound promising. 2016-10-06 04:09:46 reddit post Not to mention Doctor Who being removed from Netflix. :(

I visited France for several months last year and while there were a large amount of muslims, it didn't seem like we're on the warpath to overthrow French culture.

He very clearly and repeatedly demonstrates a lack of competent leadership. No one thinks Democrats are geniuses. No one on that list are geniuses... Sarah Palin and trump are definitely at the bottom of that barrel though. Obama was very charismatic and a very good speaker. It's obvious from listening to him for 30 seconds he's educated and witty. Is he a genius? I would never say that. Bill Clinton was also charismatic but in a different sort of way. Clearly intelligent. But not smart enough to not get caught in an affair... Hillary is really not charismatic at all and most certainly not a genius. She might be considered shrewd in some ways but she was a terrible speaker and her campaign suffered for it. I've always considered her a corporate shill.. Bush was not an eloquent public speaker under pressure and had many snafus with the press but he was charming, and I have no doubt that he's a smart man. Just look at his more recent interviews. Genius, though? Definitely, not. . Al gore inventing the Internet is a joke...

I was mostly disagreeing with the tone of the original commenter. I wasn't commending the DIY project here. I personally think that a lot of this issues that he pointed out were valid, however, there was no need for them to be a dick in their criticisms. My only point of contention would be that he knew what he was getting into. He knew that things were done incorrectly and still chose to purchase the house and fix it up. The condition of the house was the reason he got it at that price. And that in my mind really undermines any legitimacy of his complaints. 2017-01-10 18:37:14 reddit post I ... don't get it... 2017-01-10 18:19:30 reddit post I would argue the fact that it was your choice removes the validity of your complaint. 2017-01-10 17:28:22 reddit post that's true but don't buy a crap house and then complain about it being a crap house... that's like marrying a hooker and getting upset when she sleeps with other people. 2017-01-10 17:12:31 reddit post Honestly, criticism is fine when it's constructive but when you say things like this, it confuses me. Listen. I bought a house built in 1925 that has had band aids and shit work like this done on it for almost a hundred years. The tile was glued to the wall in the bathroom with liquid nails and the columns on the front porch had rotted out at the base... I understand the frustration of this but no one made you buy that house.

A pronounceable word formed from the beginnings (letter or syllable) of other words and thus representing the phrase so formed, e.g. Benelux = the countries Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg considered as a political or economic whole. ***3.) Any abbreviation so formed, regardless of pronunciation, such as TNT, BBC, IBM, or XML (see usage notes).*** This third definition is clearly in support of OP's usage. 2016-12-20 15:58:20 reddit post You have died of dysentery 2016-12-20 15:39:15 reddit post r/PeopleFuckingDying 2016-12-16 15:02:46 reddit post Their* 2016-12-15 03:07:08 reddit post lets use the Nazi symbol to remind people that there are still real problems for people in this world.. 2016-12-15 02:51:21 reddit post Jesus dies 2016-12-14 16:01:43 reddit post I LOVE THIS MOVIE! 2016-12-14 03:44:55 reddit post Operation Mockingbird. wait.

If you take those away from us, the ones that gives us the best chance of our favourite stuff, that's a huge punishment. Fine, I get not giving us 600 Common loot boxes, that'd just give us everything we want and all the shards we need. But the ten or so epics we earned? Common Blizzard.

If it wasn't for you they'd probably not have even joined chairleauge. If they wanted to replace you? Thats shitty. But they have the right to pack up and leave. You started this team because you wanted to play. You out the effort in so you could play and practice.

Lemme tell you" 2017-03-16 18:30:06 reddit post One question I'd love to get an answer too, is will StarCraft players ever get a reward like a mount in heroes of the storm just for playing the game? Hearthstone has their card back for winning 100 games WoW has Ironside for reaching level 100 And Diablo 3 has Maelthels Phantom for reaching level 70 with a seasonal character I know some people argue we have void speeder, but thats for preordering and spending more money. Not playing the game we already love. I was wondering if there's ever be a reward like a zerfling mount, (Or and overlord designed o be sat on like the treasure goblin) 2017-03-16 18:26:01 reddit post I can answer the second half. Specialists were good at lane clearing and PvE, but thats just because of the ones released. The real point of the specialist role, is to put the characters that are too weird to fit elsewhere. Without it, you'd probably squeeze then into a variety of other roles but they'd not quite fit. I'm not good enough to balance Probius, but here's a fun idea for resource management. 2017-03-16 17:42:09 reddit post So, something people always talk about is how Blizzard hasn't quite nailed the fantasy of Probius. I kind of agree. As much as I love the character, the abilities are lacking. But I'm not here to talk about that. I'm here to talk about his mana. We've got a bunch if unique mana elements in game so far, and I'd like to give Probius one. Make it so that whenever Probius is near an enemy minion, hero or structure or ally hero or structure, they drop minerals. Enemy heroes dropping gold minerals. Then make all of his abilities cost minerals instead of mana, so you spend everyfight running around gathering minerals. I'd also like to see his auto attack removed, and replaced with either an extra cannon, or a gateway that behaves kinda like a misha. Spawning a single Zealot (at the cost of some minerals) that will behave as his auto attack. Maybe you could talent into it at 13 or 16 to get a second zealot, or a sentry, or a stalker. But the main point of this post is minerals for mana.I think running around the battlefield gather minerals while everyone is fighting would a lot of fun! 2017-03-14 20:15:53 reddit post I'll be honest, the fact that you're working on loosing weight would keep me around too. But maybe for different reasons. I don't mind gals on the bigger side anyway, but just knowing they are working hard to improve themselves is one of the biggest turn ons. I've been surrounded by people all my life who complain and never take action. So you pushing yourself? You seeing something you don't like about yourself and changing it? That's an amazing and beautiful thing about you! Even if it's the long game, and taking you a long time, or you have set backs, the fact you keep trying to improve it is seriously an awesome trait to have in a partner. 2017-03-14 20:09:51 reddit post Being tall. "Oooh a love a man who is six feet!" "Nah I don't need any help, I can get that myself" You say as you reach to the top shelf where the employee needed a step stool just so they could stretch and maybe almost knock it down with their finger tips. BUT Houses are not built for us. Or cars. Straight up. If you ever go on a drive more than 20 minutes with a tall person, give them shotgun so they can push the seat back. PLEASE. Or public transit. If you ever see a man, sitting kinda sideways so he's sorta taking up two seats worth of space he almost certainly is not doing it to be a dick and if you try to sit next to him he'll straighten out. But just know you're condeming him to smacking his knees against the hard metal/plastic of the seats in front of you. (And the reason he doesn't just stand is because he's got to bend down so as not to hit the ceiling for every bump in the road.) You will always be called on to get that high thing off the shelf, even though you're relaxed and doing what ever in another room. "It's just easier for you to grab it than for me to get the step stool out and use that." And pants. DEAR GOD THE PANTS. Good fucking luck finding anything with longer than a 32 leg but still reasonably fitted for your waist. Shirts are also difficult. The "Big and tall" shop is quite literal. It's not Big OR Tall. No. You get something with the right sleeve and torso length and then you realize it looks like you're wearing an elephant's discarded skin for how baggy it is on you. But lord help you if you shop in the regular person's section. Looks like a regular person shopping in the kids section. And honestly I could go on and on. But I'll let other tall folks respond with their own issues. I wouldn't trade being tall, for being average. But there are way more cons than pros. (It's just one of the few things that makes me feel special.) STORY TIME: I was short until junior high, where I grew from like 5'4 to 6'3 over the course of like, grade 8-9. GROWING PAINS SUCK! It's literally your bones growing faster than your muscles and RIPPING THEM TO FIT. But that's not the story. The story is funnier. I was not used to being GIANT so I would constantly walk into street signs that I used to be able to walk under. Just like. For a year and half. Constantly walking into them, because they were "just" above eye level for me. But not forehead level. 2017-03-13 13:44:37 reddit post We're in Marvelstudios. I assumed it was implicit that I was talking about a marvel studios version of the fantastic four 2017-03-13 13:10:35 reddit post Easy. They become super between their movie and the most recent other MCU movie. 2017-03-13 13:09:34 reddit post Rule 6? My(brief) take on a fantastic four trilogy 2017-03-13 05:40:42 reddit post Film one Fantastic four are already established, they are jetting around and save an alien from the Skrulls he tells of how they invaded his planet. UN doesn't believe them. Thinks they're being radicals. Skrulls show up, UN gets really cosy with them. FF fights super skrull who was made after their first fight gets beat. Is revealed by Doctor Doom that the UN has been infiltrated by skrulls. War breaks out. Show various countries falling to skrulls Scene of Latveria fighting off skrull armada with doom bots. FF repels skrull invasion fleet some how with super science after beating the super skrull. Movie 2 Doom thinks the world is not prepared to defend itself. Goes about classic world domination plan based on time travel He succeeds. Fantastic Four realize he used time travel, but because they were in the negative zone or in a pocket dimension discovered by Reed, they realize they weren't effected by the shift in reality, revealing to reed multiversal theory based on alternate time lines. They find a way back in time and restore their time line. Movie ends with Silver warning of the coming of Galactus. Third movie FF attempt to communicate with Galactus before he reaches earth, they fight Stardust and Terrax who will serve as his heralds and they are chased back to earth. Silver surfer tells them of the ultimate nulifier. They go on adventure to find it. While searching, reed also searches for planets upon which Galactus could feed. They threaten Galactus with the ultimate nulifier, with no intention of using it. The heralds realize it and attack them, silver surfer helps and they win this time. Reed makes a deal with Galactus for earths safety in exchange for the coordinates of these viable but uninhabited planets Galactus agrees. For now. Honestly, the FF should spend as little time on earth or in our reality as possible. Maybe have them fight the mole man in one or two of these movies, but really lean in too the crazy exploration side of them. 2017-03-11 17:06:45 reddit post Oh gotcha. Neat. 2017-03-11 17:02:52 reddit post If you honestly have players that cause that much of a ruckus, they're not looking for a fun fantasy adventure game. They're just looking to argue to make themselves look superior. 2017-03-11 16:37:52 reddit post Yeah man, go for it. The thing about "evolution" and "physics" in these worlds is there are literally dozens of creation stories for the different races and creatures and upside down flowing waterfalls that you can directly ask a god and your god WILL respond. There's very little room for people to refute that "Trexes wouldn't live in this part of the world alongside modern deer" when Bobo the god of doesntgiveashitaboutyouropinion decides hea going to do that, and make the trexes opera singers. While looking your character in the eye. That and YOU are the final arbiter of even those gods. You're king of the world. You can make a new god who does all these things if you want. You could literally add Bobo. OR you can just make rocks fall from the sky until your players agree with you 2017-03-11 06:10:03 reddit post For sure. If you were in Toronto I'd suggest a Free Form fusion between our mains. That'd look stupid in a fun way haha 2017-03-11 06:04:05 reddit post Yeah. That's a problem I had with my gold skinned alien. I gave him crazy green Raditz Hair and he looked epic. But a lot of his fusions just looked off. 2017-03-11 05:56:03 reddit post Yeah. Aliens are probably the most fun. (Plus their skills are way more fun than any of the others except maybe Namekians but I haven't played one yet!) 2017-03-11 05:24:53 reddit post Hey there, I dunno if this is still open. But it looks like I'm going to be all alone on my birthday and I'd love some pizza to keep me company. (People keep canceling on me over facebook, and have been over the last few days.) I want to stress. I don't need the pizza. But I always eat pizza and watch anime when I'm stressed or sad. APM Through the roof, Keyboard warrior style 2017-03-11 02:27:23 reddit post Now I know what you're going to be thinking, this guy is here making fun of Keyboard warriors and toxic players he just played with. BUT NO! Hear now, the Saga of Feed Lord and Local Psycho. (If you boys check the Subreddit, I'm Alabaster.) These guys had played in around five games together before our match on towers of Doom. I started a game with them once before that. Toxic banter blasted back and forth. Either one, or the other was a troll came cries from either side. But LO! I called. "Everyone has bad games. Let's do our best, and play to win!" But the banter continued. Lost had we yes, but insight I had gained. For next map was towers of doom, and I refused to be pained. For matched on my Team, were once again these two. Bickering back and forth, oh what too do? With glee and a smile "New match! New Start!" I said these words, for I believed them from the bottom of my heart. I encouraged play, that would win the day. First and second pick went Support and tank? Hip hip, hooray! Our last three could flex, with last pick being me. Our draft was top notch, and the match... It was one to watch! We juked and we roamed. The enemy team, was owned. The bile stopped flying, the enemies. Kept dying. We captured forts and mercs, and narry a shrine did we miss. Though when enemies capture two, neither "Troll" did take the piss. We got wiped once all game, but neither did flame, we bounced back and won, bringing us to the hall of fame! A bad game, can be had. One two, or even five! This does not mean that you or he are bad. We learned to work together, and tuck the toxic behavior away. And in the end, positivity and team work did save our day! Too often we lash out, when someone's day has gone wrong. They fight back, at the feel of your sharpened word prong. We pokes and we prods, we stoke the flames in this game without mods. Allowing one's bad day to feed another, when in a different queue you might have found a brother. Learn from these two heroes of this day, for they did not let the tilt ruin their play. There is a lesson to be learned here, less you be burned my dear. 2017-03-11 01:27:22 reddit post I have a "It just does" attitude. The gods made it so, and the gods weave the fabric of the natural world. So what ever exists can exist because the gods have willed reality to accommodate such aberrations. 2017-03-11 01:21:25 reddit post Power Alien. You're just a badass. You could 1v5 most storyline fights honestly. You'll probably need to handicap your main with bad fusions to keep the game interesting, but those moments where you just wanna feel like a badass are all yours. 2017-03-11 01:20:19 reddit post Yeah, I know your pain. In my case, I wouldn't fuse my main with anyone who would push him above A rank, and I'd just use low level people. (Often A rank or lower. Try Fusing Chaitzu and Tien for a super cool/powerful/but not OP character. He honestly has one of the best character designs.) Chaitzu and Guldo also makes a super cute/cool guy. But that's almost post game content. Honestly, I just love all of Chiatzu's fusions. (Even though I hate chiatzu.) Haha 2017-03-10 16:28:19 reddit post Really? That's lame 2017-03-10 16:13:24 reddit post I just want a free Mount for playing StarCraft 26 [m4f] Toronto - Ontario - Looking to switch the roles and have someone chase me for my birthday 2017-03-09 22:12:52 reddit post https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3_IXmA-9-/ Let's get that right there out the way. There's me, in all my Rugged, Harry Potter looking glory (Raven Claw for life) Now, as the post title implies, I want to switch things around for a day. I want people to message me, to suggest dates and just take the lead. To take me out to dinner or drinks or coffee. I am quite happy taking the lead, 90% of the time, and paying when I can and just going down ye old fashioned route. But it's my birthday, and I'd love to see life from the other side. (So also feel free to send me awful messages asking for nudes and the such. Actually don't do that. That'd be awful. Haha) As to what you get out of the deal, I mean. If the picture of that gorgeous hunk of man meat was not enough to entice you, well. I've got a way with words. Aside from referring too myself as a hunk of man meat. That... That was probably a mistake. I love conversation, getting to know people, talking about the mundane and the exotic. Discussing fantasy, Sci-Fi, politics (In a discussion kind of way. Not trying to convince you of my way of thinking you not trying to convince me of yours, a healthy exchange of ideas. I'm more left leaning than right leaning just as an FYI.) I am clever and funny and collected. If you're shy, and you aren't sure if you want to message me copy and paste this. "I am willing to take you out on a date and take the lead on our first date, I am just a bit shy about the first message" And I'll take the lead for that. Because though I'm an ambivert myself, I don't want to exclude Introverts from messaging me. Basically, I want good company and a fun time. I want a date or two too look forward too next week And I'm looking to fall in love, but I'm not against just enjoying another person's company for the sake of it. And if you're going out drinking tonight? Have one for me! 26 [m4f] Toronto - Ontario - Looking to switch the roles and have someone chase me for my birthday 2017-03-09 21:24:39 reddit post https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3_IXmA-9-/ Let's get that right there out the way. There's me, in all my Rugged, Harry Potter looking glory (Raven Claw for life) Now, as the post title implies, I want to switch things around for a day. I want people to message me, to suggest dates and just take the lead. To take me out to dinner or drinks or coffee. I am quite happy taking the lead, 90% of the time, and paying when I can and just going down ye old fashioned route. But it's my birthday, and I'd love to see life from the other side. (So also feel free to send me awful messages asking for nudes and the such. Actually don't do that. That'd be awful. Haha) As to what you get out of the deal, I mean. If the picture of that gorgeous hunk of man meat was not enough to entice you, well. I've got a way with words. Aside from referring too myself as a hunk of man meat. That... That was probably a mistake. I love conversation, getting to know people, talking about the mundane and the exotic. Discussing fantasy, Sci-Fi, politics (In a discussion kind of way. Not trying to convince you of my way of thinking you not trying to convince me of yours, a healthy exchange of ideas. I'm more left leaning than right leaning just as an FYI.) I am clever and funny and collected. If you're shy, and you aren't sure if you want to message me copy and paste this. "I am willing to take you out on a date and take the lead on our first date, I am just a bit shy about the first message" And I'll take the lead for that. Because though I'm an ambivert myself, I don't want to exclude Introverts from messaging me. Basically, I want good company and a fun time. I want a date or two too look forward too next week And I'm looking to fall in love, but I'm not against just enjoying another person's company for the sake of it. And if you're going out drinking tonight? Have one for me! 2017-03-08 08:16:09 reddit post Here's the thing. He chose you. If it causes you too much stress for him to see her, you need to end it. But he likes her, hell he might still have a crush on her. But he chose you. The thing is, love and attraction isn't a binary "You are in love and attracted to this person" or "They are my platonic friend" There are so many layers. But at the end if the day, he chose you. If you think he will cheat with her, then you think he'll cheat with anyone. But just because he's attracted to other people, and he is. Doesn't mean he'd want to betray you for them. He wants you more than anyone else. Thats why he is with you. But he still has friends, and he's probably attracted to several. People often make friends with people who are about as attractive as them selves, but people usually try to date up. So, he can see an attraction and appeal too this person, but she is less than you in his eyes. Don't another his friendship, but instead reinforce your relationship. Don't tolerate any betrayal or foolishness. Don't punish natural attractions or crushes. You can't help who you're attracted too, but he wants a romance and future with you until he makes you think otherwise. 2017-03-08 08:02:51 reddit post I just want a high level ai for when someone drops, instead of the beginner level awful ai we get. 2017-03-08 02:50:56 reddit post That's because he'd die if he spends much time outside the sewers. So like, Venom could call on him if he needs too. 2017-03-07 05:21:10 reddit post https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C11MzbEcHlw 2017-03-07 05:10:00 reddit post And when you disconnect during the MVP screen, which really mucks up my machine sometimes.

Maybe switch tychus for hammer. But yes all prtoss sounds rad af 2017-03-05 21:34:10 reddit post Thanks for producing fun content (That kinda hits close too home haha) least I could do is spread the word 2017-03-05 21:19:32 reddit post u/spanglerBQ just let me know if you want me to take this down so you can post it here. I just wanted to share it with more folks! u/spanglerBQ made this hilarious "What if there were honest internet porn commercial's" video, and it plays like a hilarious version of one of those prescription drug commercials 2017-03-05 21:19:07 reddit post Wise words from r/gaming 2017-03-05 21:07:39 reddit post "When Cod Meets Dark Souls" 2017-03-05 21:04:09 reddit post https://imgur.com/gallery/H0KWoUF So. I saw that link, and it got me thinking. Wouldn't that be an amazing game? You and up too three other guys, (Or do it solo) need to work your way though a city and find the source of the monsters. What would make this interesting, is the source could be literally anywhere each playthrough. It changes everytime you start the game, as well as the locations of bosses. Maybe even bosses roam around, so you've got to run and hide until you're ready for it. Friendly camps spawn of soldiers and mythical warriors, and you can see them fighting the monsters from time too time. Maybe gangs of looters and criminals and poachers attack you as well. I'd play the hell out of a game like that. 2017-03-05 09:36:26 reddit post What was the loan for? 2017-03-05 07:37:00 reddit post I want to break all the heroes though. That's the laugh about it. 1 I'd love to see a sing off Between Gaston (Beauty and the Beast) and Maui (Moana) singing about how great they are and how much everyone loves them. 2017-03-05 05:40:19 reddit post I love both Gaston and Maui. They're two of the most Charismatic characters around. And their songs, singing about how great they are, are just so much fun! I can just imagine the two of them going toe too toe. Gaston: "While I might not be a Demi god, I most certainly have the bod" Maui: "With shoulders like that you're too skinny, compared too me you're quite Mini." Hah and just a back and forth banter as they try to one up one another. Ya know? What lyrics would you all use? Which background track would be best for it? Who would you vote for? I'd love to see a sing off Between Gaston (Beauty and the Beast) and Maui (Moana) singing about how great they are and how much everyone loves them. 2017-03-05 05:30:13 reddit post [removed] 2017-03-05 03:44:43 reddit post Situation as situation goes. I like to take out a wall if I'm a ranged hero, because you do that easy and stay out of the range of most towers. When I'm attacking as a siege hero, I'll usually take the gate first so my minons can get in and circle a tower. If I'm pushing with a team, I take the towers out because they'll just slow our push down by killing minions. Brawls are for broken and stupid fun, we need each brawl to get random Modifies when it starts. 2017-03-05 03:39:57 reddit post So let's say you load up mage wars. "NO COOLDOWNS" Then next game "Minions explode on death" Then next game "Heroes respawn where they died" Etc etc etc Also. We REALLY need a Brawl where everyone has all their talents unlocked I think. 2017-03-05 01:19:17 reddit post But that's the thing. It's not part of the game. Not in any meaningful way, certainly not in a way that I should get leaver and loss if I drop during it. I'd rather not have it than have the risk of that. T_T How to play Gazlowe? (Also you shouldn't get Leaver status if you drop during MVP) 2017-03-04 22:10:30 reddit post So, I'm in leaver que because I dropped during MVP (I swear something on that screen sets my system off) and I've decided to play Gazlowe. Does anyone have any solid tips on him? 2017-03-04 07:17:48 reddit post Yes. As a seven year old I was not super invested in the story. And those are the people I was talking about. 2017-03-04 07:11:22 reddit post Haha I always thought that about him 2017-03-04 01:09:21 reddit post I was talking about people that haven't played Starcraft II. 2017-03-03 23:29:20 reddit post Hah perfect response. 2017-03-03 23:27:01 reddit post Because people prefer playing Aliens. :) 2017-03-03 23:26:49 reddit post Exactly. :) Why Probius is actually the MOST iconic starcraft character we've gotten 2017-03-03 21:20:30 reddit post The year, is 1998. You're seven years old, and you've just gotten the hot new game. Starcraft. Your older brother teaches you how to play the game. "You need to build probes to harvest minerals, and build things for your base." He shows you the Arcade after the release of Broodwar. "This game here, it's called cat and mouse. You play a Probe running from the Ultralisks who are the cats" You didn't care about the story, you just wanted to play with cheats on. Since you had cheats on you loved to to stupid things like build armies of probes, drones scvs etc and trounce your enemies. You'd use your precious probes to turtle hard until you could build carriers, your only other unit. Years go by. You start playing HoTS. "Oh neat! Raynor was in Starcraft right? He's a Marine. So cool. And I remember Kerrigan from the Broodwar splash screen. Artanis? He was a corssair right? Oh Tassadar was the hero model High Templar who could attack? And there's shadow guy who always had his blinds parted slightly to allow only a little light to touch his face. Zeratul. That's in." You're reminded of all these heroes from the campaign that your brother did years ago while you anxiously awaited your turn to dick around in vs AI or the Arcade. There are many many Starcraft players who couldn't tell you who Tychus, Dehaka, Nova, or heck Even Stukov or Artanis are. But there isn't a single. Not a single Starcraft player who doesn't know who a probe is and what it does. "Cannon rush!" "He walled himself in!" "Probe rush!" When it comes to strategy RPGs the story is less important than the replayability. Starcraft has an amazing and epic story that I love. But it has an even better game play, that made it so Broodward is still a beloved and highly played game too this day. Long after you finished the several hours it took to complete the campagin, you've left the likes of Raynor, Kerrigan, and Zeratul behind. But Probius? He's been at your side or at your gates for hundreds, maybe thousands of hours. Cheesing, mining, even BMing. But he's been there. Starcaft's story is amazing and you should play it. But it's gameplay is what made it great. And that's why Probius is the most iconic Starcraft character we've received. PS: Plus he was already in the Legacy of the Void trailer so he's more cannon(heh) than SGT. Hammer or Morales. 2017-03-03 20:56:07 reddit post Not all. I think Kharazim and Valla had novels about them before hand? Maybe Nazeboo. 2017-03-03 07:13:12 reddit post To all of the people saying that it would make them a hots hero. No. It wouldn't. Here is how I would do it. Release an overwatch comic, have the character discussing with one of the main cast in ways they think they could help Overwatch. Or maybe just talking about how awesome it would be to be a superhero or some such. I make this character a giant nerd, with collectables scattered through their home from nerdy properties, (like blizzard games) and overwatch stuff. They fall asleep and begin dreaming of themselves in a battlesuit with an awesome weapon they've never seen before. But, they are in the nexus! Battling characters and monsters from all the games they've known about for years. But now its a battle to the death. They wake up from their "dream" (was it really a dream? Maybe have a gift from Tyrande fall out of their pocket and roll under a couch so you are left to winder if it is another collectable or an actual artifact from Azeroth) and are inspired! They use their engineering knowhow to produce the same gear they wielded while in the Nexus. They call their friend again and tell them "Give me a few months, I have an idea" Release this hero in HOTS first, you are playing them in their "dream". Then release them in overwatch. They were introduced in overwatch first via a comic, so the character is actually from overwatch. 2017-03-03 07:03:21 reddit post Azmodan gets shit Azmo-done in gold league 2017-03-03 07:01:43 reddit post Fenix is already done. They were going to release him right after Leoric but didn't want that many death effects in a row. I assume with the talent updates and other new hero releases he's been changed quite a bit though. 2017-03-03 05:14:28 reddit post That is Venom fused with Creep! Creep, his life long ally who swore a blood oath to forever be by his side whenever he was needed, who gave him the strength to scare the Juggernaut off. Creep whom was never heard from or mentioned again! When a man undoes his belt on his way to the bathroom, you know some serious shit is about to go down. 2017-03-02 01:55:23 reddit post 2017-03-01 19:06:31 reddit post Is your Team Retreating, or charging? Speed. Is the Enemy Winding up an AoE or Skill shot? Speed. Is one of your allies poisned and about to die beacuse of it? Health? Or you in the middle of a bru-ha-ha with people trading blows back and forth, but no real movement? Health. Are you in the backline waiting for your chance to move in? Health. Are both teams waiting for the right chance to strike, for the other team to make the first move? Health. I keep getting dropped during Capture the Flag while defending as bastion. Is there any warning I should look out for when it is about to drop me?

Saying Old people shouldn't hang out with young people is how you get a goddamn age gap. It's sweet if a teenager makes friends with someone in an old folks home, but not someone twenty years younger? That's taboo. 2017-02-27 06:29:58 reddit post It's guys like you I loved growing up. My brother had a bunch of nerdy older friends. (And he was 5 years older htan me) and I loved the moments I got to hangout with them. I just didn't enjoy the same things as people my age and I am still glad I spent time with them the way I did. 2017-02-27 06:28:02 reddit post Any physical contact with anyone these days is immediate cause for revulsion and disgust it seems. 2017-02-27 06:27:06 reddit post Right? I always related to my brother's friends more than my own. I never wanted to do crazy ass shit. I just wanted to play Magic the Gathering and DnD. And Guess fucking what. Some of those guys were easily over ten years older than me and they were, and are still super cool. Letting the kid tag a long and play their nerd games. 2017-02-27 06:23:25 reddit post Man I hate threads like this. I'm 25, and I dated a 17 year old last year. We had a ton of fun, and enjoyed one another's company. Eventually we parted ways and we still talk. I give her advice and what not. People underestimate teenagers. "When I was a teenager I was so dumb lololol so all of them must be" sure. Maybe. But there's also young adults making brilliant leaps in engineering or athletics. Young adults are just that, young adults. That's why dating them is Legal. Do you look a bit weird? Probably. But does it matter if you're both happy? And yes. There are scum bags who would take advantage of it. But there are also young people who take advantage of the desires of older folks. (Check any dating site for any number of girls looking for a sugar daddy) It's like bad people come in all ages or something. Not every teenager should date an adult. And MOST CERTAINLY not every adult should date a teenager. But if two people have common ground and love one another. Live and let live.

I'm going to put my best foot forward, and trip myself by throwing out the negatives, and I want you to do the same. 2017-02-18 21:09:33 reddit post Inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buKMOxNzYjY Which is funny as it is informative and depressing, I'm going to throw myself out there and just be honest. But the thrust of it is, just share everything about yourself rather than just the generic nonsense. Share the parts about yourself that might be a red flag for one person, or the holy grail for another. Because rather than have this thing come up as a deal breaker later, it happens now, neither of you waste time and you're more likely to find someone who fits your quirks, kinks, and faults. First off. I want someone who thinks two people reading in the same room at the same time counts as doing something together. Stole that line straight from the video (For real, watch it.) but goddamn it's so true. And it doesn't just have to be reading, like you can be watching videos or playing video games or knitting or what ever. I just like, being with my partner, ya know? On too the radical honesty part. I've got depression. I don't let it effect how I interact with people, I'm as charming and smooth as butter. But sometimes I withdraw. I don't text, I don't message I don't call. And I don't just mean the person I'm dating. I mean anyone. I'm honestly not trying to ignore you or make you feel neglected when I do. But it is what it is. For a job, I'm a Nanny. It's amazing. I love kids. I'm a Dork, and a geek. DnD, Dad Jokes, Video Games, Anime, comics, hell. Even LARPing. On the topic of LARPing I love camping. It's great to be in the great outdoors in a tent. Solo or with friends. I'm 6'3, I've got a red beard and brown hair, and glasses that make me look like Harry Potter. I love physical affection. I don't mean like, hanky panky either.

Karaoke, acting and most recently I've been working on a Comedy Set that I think is pretty solid. I like women of all shapes sizes and age, short girls are great, but being 6'3 MOST women are shorter, and I don't mind gals who are taller. I'm a little pickier when it comes to men though. I prefer guys shorter than me, little body hair ideally, around my age (In their twenties) and I LOVE the hipster look. Trans Male and Female friendly. I think it's important we're both attracted to one another. I can be friends with someone I don't find attractive but I cannot date them. It's not fair to either of us, and, unless you're Asexual, I want to be the sexiest mother lover in the world too you. On the note of Asexuality. I'm a sexual guy with a variety of kinks. I don't need to dive into all of them obviously, and I can get by on minimal sexuality. BUT I do need that in my life. I know plenty of Asexual folks who participate with their partner for that kind of thing even if it does nothing for them, but I don't want to pressure you into doing stuff you don't want too do. I want both of us to be fulfilled in Mental, emotional and physical needs. Ideally I'll meet someone who is at least a little active. I like being out and about from time to time, and the more active you are the more motivated I become. This if course doesn't limit you if you're physically unable to participate in certain activities. I just want to be as honest as I can about where I'm at with whatever. Please, ask me questions. Even if you don't want to date me. I will add them into the body of my post so more people can see them. I want to date someone who wants me for me after all. I'm primarily monogamous but I'm open to a Poly relationship where I'm the primary partner. (I'm also open to dating people in Poly relationships, but long term I will be looking for a primary person.) Also, here's a joke from my set that is slightly topical. ^"As ^you ^can ^see, ^I'm ^a ^tall ^guy. ^6'3. ^Despite ^that, ^I ^wont ^date ^a ^person ^who ^has ^a ^height ^requirement ^for ^their ^men. ^I ^want ^to ^show ^solidarity ^with ^my ^five ^foot ^brothers. ^Someone ^has ^to ^stand ^up ^for **^^the ^^^little ^^^^guy."** 2017-02-18 03:40:16 reddit post Duuude.

I get "Error code: 80110327" whenever I try to save. The other issue I have is with Suikoden Tierkreis on the DraStic emulator. I accidentally set the language to french, but even going into the system options to change it to english doesn't help. I've uninstalled the app, and I've deleted the game and added it in a new folder but it sill doesn't change to english. Any tips? 25 [M4R] Toronto - Radical Honesty from a Bi Man.

I'm going to put my best foot forward, and trip myself by throwing out the negatives, and I want you to do the same. 2017-02-17 06:33:31 reddit post Inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buKMOxNzYjY Which is funny as it is informative and depressing, I'm going to throw myself out there and just be honest. But the thrust of it is, just share everything about yourself rather than just the generic nonsense. Share the parts about yourself that might be a red flag for one person, or the holy grail for another. Because rather than have this thing come up as a deal breaker later, it happens now, neither of you waste time and you're more likely to find someone who fits your quirks, kinks, and faults. First off. I want someone who thinks two people reading in the same room at the same time counts as doing something together. Stole that line straight from the video (For real, watch it.) but goddamn it's so true. And it doesn't just have to be reading, like you can be watching videos or playing video games or knitting or what ever. I just like, being with my partner, ya know? On too the radical honesty part. I've got depression. I don't let it effect how I interact with people, I'm as charming and smooth as butter. But sometimes I withdraw. I don't text, I don't message I don't call. And I don't just mean the person I'm dating. I mean anyone. I'm honestly not trying to ignore you or make you feel neglected when I do. But it is what it is. For a job, I'm a Nanny. It's amazing. I love kids. I'm a Dork, and a geek. DnD, Dad Jokes, Video Games, Anime, comics, hell. Even LARPing. On the topic of LARPing I love camping. It's great to be in the great outdoors in a tent. Solo or with friends. I'm 6'3, I've got a red beard and brown hair, and glasses that make me look like Harry Potter. I love physical affection. I don't mean like, hanky panky either. Holding hands, hugging, ideal touches on the shoulder or head or what ever. Someone scratching my beard (Which I'm not married too by the way.

Karaoke, acting and most recently I've been working on a Comedy Set that I think is pretty solid. I like women of all shapes sizes and age, short girls are great, but being 6'3 MOST women are shorter, and I don't mind gals who are taller. I'm a little pickier when it comes to men though. I prefer guys shorter than me, little body hair ideally, around my age (In their twenties) and I LOVE the hipster look. Trans Male and Female friendly. I think it's important we're both attracted to one another. I can be friends with someone I don't find attractive but I cannot date them. It's not fair to either of us, and, unless you're Asexual, I want to be the sexiest mother lover in the world too you. On the note of Asexuality. I'm a sexual guy with a variety of kinks. I don't need to dive into all of them obviously, and I can get by on minimal sexuality. BUT I do need that in my life.

I was using my track pad, just having a grand ol' time. Then hopped into facebook messenger, and when I went to change tabs. It wasn't responding.

Any advice? 2017-02-14 02:17:11 reddit post Of course not. It could even be considered a weaker silence since the enemy can choose to take the damage, or not. But it either shuts down a skill or hurts, it's up to the enemy.

I checked the [changelog](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases) and version for uBlock and it hasn't updated today which is when the issue began.

NFI what the exact story was. #2 the second story I remember was about some people (a couple?) getting lost and ending up in a village. They go to this one house and are fed rabbit stew. I especially remember this part. The village people help them but are quite sinister and when they try to escape they can't. It'd be amazing if anyone can find me the name of this movie.

Even if it is just a few people talking about being vegan fitness people and their struggles. You need to visually tell a story about the need for this product. Backers don't want to read much. You have to tell them and the video is the way to do it. As for the rewards, they should be incremental. $15 buys one pack of donuts, $25 buys two and so on. People who give more should get more. If you are going to develop some donut recipes, why not offer people the ability to be early taste-testers? For $25 you will be sent three different donut recipes and a survey card to determine which you like best By the way, you can learn a lot about running a successful Kickstarter campaign online. I'm not a genius and I've only done four campaigns. 2016-06-29 16:50:33 reddit post I doubt the whole thing is "fake" as in these people are going to take all of the money and spend it on strippers, but I think this project looks way too early to be on Kickstarter. Too many 3D models in the images and the gear shifting in the video looks horrid. I do like how the guy has a black suit on and an old pair of nikes though. This project is definitely a high-risk proposal. 2016-06-29 16:48:00 reddit post Thanks for the comments. The mat material is standard PVC, just like most of the mats sold at Target, Walmart, Sporting Goods stores. The quality and stickiness are not out of the ordinary. Hugger Mugger has a bunch of different mats and its a great site for folks who are really serious about their yoga, but I don't think we are dealing with the same people. Our target customer is just a regular guy that does some yoga and has found he is much too large for the mat. They didn't seem to interested in the material of the mat, just the size and price. That's why the price is only $39. They aren't going to go for a premium priced mat and our price doesn't really indicate that it is the top of the line. As far as mention of the extra thickness we just say twice as thick in most of the description. In the technical specs it is listed at 6mm which is twice the thickness of the majority of mats you will find on the shelves of retail stores 3mm. We are hopeful that after the Kickstarter that we can find a place for our products at retail stores and websites around the country. The four items we have will fit well and look really masculine next to offerings by Gaiam and such. We would look OK on a site like Hugger Mugger because the pricing would be attractive next to the other mats. Does that make sense? It is nice to communicate with you. If you still know anyone at Hugger Mugger, have them contact us. We may have wholesale product in time for the holiday season. 2016-06-29 05:32:12 reddit post The links worked. Thank you. It looks pretty straightforward. I hope you make it across the finish line. 2016-06-29 03:31:09 reddit post I think that you have made some Kickstarter mistakes. First is the you do not have a video. People really respond to the video, it shows that you have put some effort into the product. Second, your rewards are a bit strange. For $5 you get a pack of donuts and for $25 you get a pack of donuts. It is no surprise that not a lot of people have gone for the $25 pack of donuts. 2016-06-29 03:23:10 reddit post It looks pretty cool! The pricing is really good. 2016-06-29 03:20:10 reddit post I don't have home stretch advice but I do have experience with the survey process. I had a $15,000 project and the process of collecting and exporting all of the data was a nightmare. People gave bad addresses, didn't answer the survey requests (repeatedly), etc. I will be using third party tools next time. I apologize that i don't know which ones, but anything will be better than the KS process. It was really, really labor intensive. 2016-06-29 03:17:08 reddit post This thing is really cool. I could see myself using all three of its main features and using them often. 2016-06-29 03:14:55 reddit post I think you have done an excellent job of telling your story. It looks nice too. It is fairly elegantly done. One issue is that it doesn't tell the customer's story. You don't mention the benefit to the customer. Most marketing is done in the voice of the customer, not in the seller. You should make an attempt at telling how it would work for your potential clients. "Instead of paying too much for a mechanic to diagnose, order parts for, and then repair your vehicle, you could let the collective knowledge of the internet do the first two steps and save money..." Just my 2 cents. 2016-06-29 03:09:38 reddit post I might suggest you post a link in the comments. The one in the title is hard to work with. 2016-06-28 16:51:55 reddit post If you have never launched a Kickstarter before, it is really exhilarating. We've done a lot of work with this project and I hope it takes off. Of course I believe in it, otherwise I wouldn't have worked on it, but what will others think? I hope you can follow along with me, watch the stats and see how it goes. Thanks. I just pushed the launch button for Yeoman Gear - Yoga Gear for Men (and people who are not tiny) 2016-06-28 16:49:53 reddit post 2016-06-28 04:58:24 reddit post I think ShopInPrivate.com is original. It's a store that only sells embarrassing items and does so privately. Brown box delivery and no email list. 2016-06-28 04:56:01 reddit post I sell some candies on Amazon and have tried to get approval for a category and failed. I even spoke to an actual person in support and they gave me this advice. Stop trying to resubmit a failed application and start over. I guess it is easier to get approval on the first shot. If you fail the first time, you get escalated to a real "expert" and they hardly ever bend the rules. So, try starting the ungating application again. 2016-06-28 04:16:06 reddit post This is fantastic advice. You can even get someone to pledge a dollar to your campaign on Fiverr. 2016-06-27 04:24:34 reddit post I could see how this game might (might?) be popular with people who have disabilities. It might also be the cause for divorce. Could you imagine being in the same home as someone who plays this game often? 2016-06-27 03:45:05 reddit post I found someone through Craigslist. I asked them to submit their "reel" and I watched them. Some reels were amazing. Some were horrendous. It was usually entertaining either way. In the past I have paid $100 per finished minute. I am in the Detroit area. 2016-06-26 06:46:22 reddit post Your standard mat is 3mm thick, look for one that is 6mm. It'll feel great in a lot of places, such as outside, on tile, etc. 2016-06-26 05:55:28 reddit post It might be "If we don't raise $35k, we are calling it a day and keeping our day jobs." The goal isn't always the tooling costs, sometimes it is just a number that convinces you to do the project. 2016-06-26 05:38:46 reddit post On the project side, it's a set fee to be features in the message. $379 I think. If they don't help you raise $379 they don't charge you. It's not unfair, but the average amount raised is less than $2,000 so you aren't going to get rich on the back of it. 2016-06-26 05:33:54 reddit post I know I am going to sound strange when I say this, but I recently went to my local library and took out Kickstarter for dummies and while it was a bit wordy, it is tough to replace the ability to skim through a book. I absorbed the whole thing in probably less than an hour. 2016-06-26 05:32:00 reddit post There are services called "Freight Consolidators" They take a bunch of parcels, say a pallet full of them, bring them across the border and then put the in the Canadian postal system. They can save you a bundle, probably more than 50% but you will probably need to ship 150 units or so to make it worthwhile. My company has met with this one before: http://www.reallycoolsolutions.com/

Anytime war was needed, he wanted it to be short and relatively un-damaging. He also initially didn't support taking colonies in Africa, once the Kaiser really wanted colonies Bismarck then supported them. 2017-05-09 03:18:29 reddit post Napoleon only ever declared war on Russia 2017-05-08 06:24:14 reddit post I see that due to no response, I have in fact, won this argument.

Go to r/eu4, eventually you'll find it. Who ever said I like Trump, just because I say I am a fascist doesn't mean I like him. Trump is pretty useless, that doesn't mean that im going to "resist" his rule like many others are trying to do. You cant possibly get him to step down by protesting, in the current situation. Who says Fascism is always racist? Most of the time it was, since that was the whole reason they rose in the first place. Before Italy joined the axis and/or surrendered to the allies (becoming a puppet of Germany), they were much less racist than than most other countries. When they invading Ethiopia in 1935, many of the Italian soldiers felt that they were freeing the Ethiopian slaves. 2017-05-07 19:02:25 reddit post Give me evidence of whenever Trump or Le pen is a fascist, please. 2017-05-07 18:41:10 reddit post Fascism is good.

subject398 2016-08-09 20:33:42 reddit post Once you are there for a while you become friends with some locals and they will help you. If you are moving around a lot it becomes more difficult. 2016-08-09 19:45:37 reddit post Depends on the country. Costa Rica is fairly expensive, prices are on par with the US. Most people overlook El Salvador, very cheap and very friendly people. I have spent 6 months there and haven't had or seen any problems. Get out of the bigs cities and into smaller cities. You can rent a house in Santa Ana for less than $300 a month once you get out of the gringo pricing. Other utilities including good internet total less than $100. Yea you can do it for $1000 but the more you move around the more expensive it CAN be. 2016-08-09 19:25:29 reddit post What can you do in the meat world? I'm fairly handy and personable so when I contact a place for a long term (1-3 months) stay I always ask how I can help them for lower or more often (kinda) free accommodations. I ask if they have any place that is not for tourists I can stay in so as not to fill up a room they can rent out. I will pay something up front then when I arrive I fix things that need fixing, paint, help entertain guests, cook some, help with tours, help with English and so on. I usually once a week buy food to share with my hosts, $60 - $80 and we all eat well for a week. Even with as busy as this sounds most of my time is free. I can spend 3 months in Latin America for around $500 a month with no problems and I become part of the family if they are good people. 2016-08-06 20:22:54 reddit post It is 2 different places, they are just side by side. 2016-08-02 16:29:43 reddit post I had a friend who drove west from Ohio many time and he always said that just before he would get into Kansas he would stop and get a fifth of whiskey, when he crossed the border he would put his wife behind the wheel and start drinking until the bottle was gone and so was he. He hated the boredom of driving across Kansas and it was the only state he ever complained about. Side note; Perry drank himself to death in his mid thirties. They said they could do a liver transplant if he quit drinking. He said never mind, that's not happening. 2016-07-31 03:05:39 reddit post Look into Workaway.info and just keep on going. 2016-07-31 03:00:01 reddit post Forgot to mention I was in CR for 10 days in 2010 and again in 2015 and the prices now are pretty much consistent with prices in the U.S.. I don't think it is the best for budget travelers. Plus, wherever you go make the visit as long as you possibly can so you really have the time to unwind and get to know the culture. BTW, M/64 2016-07-31 02:54:18 reddit post Check out El Salvador. Very inexpensive flights and lodging. I have spent the last 2 winters in Santa Ana and never have felt unsafe.

Hopefully he gets a suppository before taking office. 2017-01-03 23:53:40 reddit post =/= is "is not" :p 2017-01-02 07:23:45 reddit post Man, I dunno at this point. If Dubya can get a second term after 9/11, and if Trump can even be elected once, I don't see much really stopping Trump 2020. 2017-01-01 21:16:30 reddit post I can't believe you killed Hilarion Capucci like this 2016-12-28 06:02:53 reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/shitpost/comments/49gx81/fat_guy_tucks_in_his_shirt/ Just awful 2016-12-28 05:53:12 reddit post I, uh, don't think Family Guy is Star Wars. 2016-12-27 22:49:45 reddit post It's his 94th birthday tomorrow! 2016-12-27 04:11:12 reddit post Which part of Texas would you like to see bombed by nuclear weapons? 2016-12-26 18:55:28 reddit post Own any other cats? 2016-12-26 03:52:24 reddit post To be fair (if I'm remembering the commentary correctly) they cut that joke because they knew it was in poor taste and not very funny. So they aren't totally brain dead. 2016-12-26 03:51:39 reddit post Maybe in the past, but he's by far the bigger name now, and his shows already catch endless amounts of shit, they probably couldn't do much. 2016-12-26 00:44:34 reddit post Serious question, you appear to be a (reasonably) frequent poster in t_d, why didn't you vote for him? 2016-12-25 21:46:47 reddit post I agree. I get the desire people have to yell at former supporters of the Trump train, but honestly, I don't see why. It will probably just alienate them, when I find them pretty reassuring. Maybe I'm too soft (mostly because I think that myself from a few years back definitely would've gone for Trump) but I like when they pop up, it's not like we don't want people turning against Trump. 2016-12-25 07:13:47 reddit post This thread was bad. 2016-12-25 02:29:41 reddit post Wait, what?

Pence is a Christoshithead lunatic, but he has experience and I'd much rather him have the codes. Like, Trump is unhinged and unqualified in a way that's never been seen before. Also, Pence seems to want to actually be president more than Donnie. 2016-12-22 18:33:19 reddit post Don't like REM? 2016-12-22 06:20:33 reddit post Why'd you bother posting this everywhere in this thread? 2016-12-21 22:54:10 reddit post It was actually worse than that, he hated it so much that he had his name removed from the opening credits (leading it to awkwardly hang on the DEVELOPED BY screen for a fair bit of extra time). 2016-12-21 01:56:16 reddit post Later from this guy: 6"3 and 240 pounds.

If a tweet on his account is sent from an Android, he wrote it. If it's from an iPhone, his campaign wrote it.

Don't think a politically-based battery charge is going to paint him or Office Christmas Party in a good light. 2016-12-08 22:12:48 reddit post That's Scott Glenn, different guy. 2016-12-08 17:34:45 reddit post DAE did you just assume my gendr???

After he was elected he said "well, I hope he does such a great job that I'll want to vote for him next time." 2016-12-08 04:08:54 reddit post He's definitely not 6'3". In [pictures of him](http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_trump_bush_mm_150902_16x9_992.jpg) with Jeb Bush, who's 6'3", Trump is clearly ~2 inches shorter. 2016-12-07 14:33:13 reddit post It didn't? 2016-12-05 07:17:41 reddit post It's a copypasta 2016-12-03 19:41:48 reddit post Where does this post say this? 2016-12-01 22:01:53 reddit post Probably the weakest IRS album but still very solid. I'd say the best songs on it are Feeling Gravitys Pull, Driver 8, Auctioneer, Green Grow the Rushes, and Cant Get There from Here (honorable mention: Life and How to Live It). Despite some very impressive highs it's brought down because of three tracks that can't get into at all, these being Kohoutek, Old Man Kensey, and Maps and Legends. I'd rank it a 3.5/5. Oh, and one other thing: The B-side to Driver 8, Crazy, is stellar. 2016-12-01 21:49:38 reddit post Here's my attempt. Tried to pick singles that span all of their career. 1. Radio Free Europe 2. So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry) 3. Driver 8 4. The One I Love 5. It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine) 6. Stand 7. Losing My Religion 8. Everybody Hurts 9.

Rile him up, in the extraordinarily unlikely chance he sees them? Not sure why you'd want that. 2016-11-29 16:38:49 reddit post I'd say the citizenship stripping thing is all on him. 2016-11-29 16:14:10 reddit post Why would Trump care about something done over a decade ago by someone he literally just beat, and what's the purpose of this master plan? 2016-11-29 15:46:40 reddit post This guy is on a rampage with that link all over this thread. It's like, are you kidding me? What reason is there to care about Clinton anymore? 2016-11-29 06:19:04 reddit post I didn't say I supported importing terrorists or making the problem worse. But I don't think Trump will be able to do what the OP thinks he can. 2016-11-29 06:04:43 reddit post Eh? The OP says Trump will clean up "this mess", but there isn't going to be a way for Trump to be able to stop attacks from the many, many Muslims already here legally, like this guy. How is the murderer thing relevant? 2016-11-28 04:37:00 reddit post Also Ringo is killer at keeping time, Lars not so much. 2016-11-27 08:01:43 reddit post That's this guy's real name.

Since he voted for Hillary, I assume Trump will have nothing but good things to say about him. 2016-11-26 23:19:26 reddit post Who are the three in this case? 2016-11-25 17:28:45 reddit post Your grandad was Russ Mayberry?

He was alright riffing in the live reunion though, so I'm willing to give him a shot as long as his theater segments are fine. 2016-11-24 04:27:10 reddit post It Will Never Top /r/mrwundy So, that spez the_donald controversy... 2016-11-24 04:22:29 reddit post it's time to bringbackpao 2016-11-24 03:17:30 reddit post It's pretty good.

Regardless of what you think of either, he was far more qualified than Trump. 2016-11-19 04:34:03 reddit post That's angry? 2016-11-19 04:33:06 reddit post Dude, calm down. Even if you have a legit point to make allcaps rage is not going to get people to read it. 2016-11-18 22:35:51 reddit post I know what Chappelle did but what did Hanks say? All I saw from him about the election was him saying "America is in trouble if we elect Trump" or something. 2016-11-18 16:19:53 reddit post So people care. 2016-11-17 21:05:42 reddit post I think the best part was when Graham Chapman stated that he knew John Cleese had not read the book. This contrasted quite humorously with Cleese's above statement, where he appeared to have read the book based on the fact that he gave an opinion on its quality. 2016-11-16 21:37:57 reddit post How are you bothered by someone saying that, historically, being a white man is far preferable to any other sex/race? It's just true 2016-11-14 18:08:43 reddit post Just swap out the "tube" in youtube with "pak" 2016-11-14 14:26:05 reddit post I still see it pop up occasionally. Even as someone who leans left it's pretty damn stupid. Trump ancestor changed their name when he came to America, how exactly does it matter that he didn't revert to it? I could've tolerated it if it he just went "lolzers drumpf sounds funny" but he tried attaching the Stewart thing to it, which isn't an equivelant. 2016-11-13 17:02:17 reddit post Mike Pence is around 5'10". And yes, Trump has tall genes in him. His first son Don Jr is a pretty average 6' but Eric Trump is 6'5" and Ivanka is 5'11". 2016-11-12 16:30:44 reddit post Family Guy is also soon to be four. 2016-11-11 23:15:30 reddit post I think it was probably a mistake. They were reworking the episode so late that the censors likely didn't catch it. 2016-11-11 20:45:46 reddit post Has to be the scandal, this episode first aired in May 2008 2016-11-11 03:11:06 reddit post John Berry is a bit of a sore thumb there. 2016-11-10 14:36:58 reddit post It doesn't really make sense though. Trump never changed his name, it was done way, way, back, he kinda didn't really have a say in the matter. Stewart dropped his surname himself. I liked Oliver's segment but the Drumpf stuff is cringeworthy. 2016-11-10 14:31:37 reddit post Of course she died. RIP 2016-11-08 19:08:13 reddit post I Voted!!! 2016-11-07 15:53:11 reddit post I am only allowed to post once every 10 minutes because I am anti-Hillary. Huh? 2016-11-07 06:48:51 reddit post U2. If I recall correctly, on Boy, Bono and Adam Clayton were 19 while The Edge and Larry Mullen Jr. were 18. On blink-182's first album Cheshire Cat, Mark Hoppus is 22 while Tom DeLonge is 19 and Scott Raynor is 16. 2016-11-05 18:57:42 reddit post I'm pretty sure that comment was genuine. 2016-11-04 20:35:43 reddit post Harry Shearer is getting up there. He's 73 next month, and has a notable lack of interest in the show (remember when he quit for like 2 months last year?). Also Kavner's age definitely shows. It's not her fault, of course, but Marge's voice has devolved over the years into a really harsh croak and it's painful at times to listen to. I can't imagine what she'll sound like when she's 76 2016-11-04 15:25:01 reddit post Bowie released an album two days before he died, he was definitely more relevant than Ali. 2016-11-04 03:15:38 reddit post https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/344898458169257984 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/344905633579012097 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/344988801850015744 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/344994207292870656 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/344998020787621888 2016-11-03 23:19:37 reddit post Will never not confuse this one with Driver 8. 2016-11-02 04:12:07 reddit post What happened there?

I have 42 now and back in high school I had my heart broken by friend and boyfriends alike.

Need Some Advice on a New Monitor 2017-02-20 11:23:17 reddit post Hey guys, Im going to swirch out my 5 year old Benq moniyor with something much more nice. My budget is around 300 USD (Im from Norway so monitors you suggest to that price might be alot more expensive for me, but i'll look into all suggestions). I'd like a screen with really nice colors, something i belive IPS Monitors will give me? A high refreshrate would alsp be nice. I've only had 60hz until now, so something higher would be nice. I bet this question has been posted here millions of times, so im sorry about that but im just seeking some quick tips. Thank you. Trend OfficeScan Server, update from 10.6 to 11. 2017-02-20 11:06:03 reddit post Hey guys, I have a Test Environment with a Main Server (Domain controller and all that), and a Trend Officescan server. I also have 2 Clients for testing the Officescan server. My next task is to update the Trend Officescan server from 10.6 to 11, and it's really hard! I cant find any proper tutorial or documentation on how to do this online. And also im just an IT-apprentice so im not the best guy on this area. The officescan 10.6 server, is setup and integrated with AD, and I've setup a logon script that automatically installs the Client software. This logon script works beside that it always asks me to logon as an admin in order to install it. I dont know where the right permission has to be put in order to make this go away. But anyways the main problem is the update, so if anyone here knows how to do this or if someone could point me in the right direction that would be great.

The universe is so big that there's gotta be planets that harbor life; out of the trillions of planets, even a minute chance of life would result in thousands of civilizations. Theoretically, there should be plenty of alien civilizations more advanced than us. Earth is a pretty young planet - 4.5 billion years old, the universe reached the ability to harbor life about 10 billion years ago, other planets can be billions of years older and have much more time to develop intelligent life. The thing is there isn't anyone out there - that we know of, and that makes me worried, or anxious, or whatever you're supposed to feel stuck on a wet mud ball in endless space all alone. About discovering alien life, I would err on the cautious side. God, don't we have enough problems on Earth as it is, to not go looking for more? I don't wanna worry about intergalactic politics. Also, look what happened when the Europeans discovered America. What if the aliens bring a plague? I think if we ever find aliens, we should take things slowly. Careers? Translators for sure, I bet the space travel industry will become really popular, and perhaps tourism? Maybe aliens like beer, who knows? Do they have internet, what do they even use to communicate? There will certainly be mailing services, I bet amazon will change their one-day delivery policy, though. The military's gonna go crazy, I'm sure. Send spies to other planets and develop anti-alien-invasion weapons. In my opinion, we shouldn't meddle with aliens before we solve our own issues. It will be nice to know we're not alone though.

You can use it to dot (is that the right word?) your drawings to lighten overly shaded areas like you would a sponge on paintings. A useful thing to have, although it gradually soakes up more lead and gets harder, eventually to the point you'll have to get a new one. 2017-03-17 19:34:31 reddit post Not OP, you can use a thin eraser to create highlights too. Not sure about hair, but when you draw stuff like glass that has a lot of reflections, you erase out the highlights last with erasers. Take my word with a grain of salt though, it's been a few years since my last drawing lessons. 2017-03-17 19:22:32 reddit post Sorry, but can you explain why it'll enter the atmosphere every orbit? You can clearly tell I don't know much about physics, but I'm just toying with this idea. Theoretically, can you launch the cannonball at a really high speed, say, 90% of the speed of light (a lil too fast but you get what I'm saying), and have it stay in orbit, or will it just overheat the air and generate plasma and explosions and all that shit due to the atmosphere? 2017-03-17 19:13:05 reddit post Yeah but thats basically how they launch rockets. I was exploring the idea of shooting a canon on the ground, sideways, and have it go into orbit. 2017-03-17 19:01:21 reddit post What if its really fast? Is there no way at all? 2017-03-17 18:40:25 reddit post You don't need to go high to go to space, you just need to go fast. I think it was 8km per second, correct me if I'm wrong. Can you launch a cannonball into orbit by firing it at the horizon really fast? Assuming there's no obstacles in the way. 2017-03-17 17:53:50 reddit post No its true.

It's just pretty fascinating for movie geeks like myself to see the franchise evolve from four movies in a row that always ended up Rotten on Rotten Tomatoes to its next three movies becoming critical darlings (with each one being rated Fresh).

Two of the biggest franchises around in one film? That film would make ALL THE MONEY. 2017-04-08 21:04:19 reddit post Considering the next 3 films are very likely to gross over $1 billion worldwide each (Furious 7 grosses $1.5 billion worldwide), it would be a dumb financial move for Universal not to continue the franchise after the tenth installment (which is the third part of a trilogy starting with Fast 8).

It's going to have to do extremely well in Japan and China, in my opinion, to justify a sequel.

The future looks dicey indeed for future live-action anime adaptations. Great number for The Boss Baby - I definitely was not expecting it to end up beating Beauty and the Beast (which nonetheless did very well) this weekend. It sucks to see Power Rangers have a huge drop - I'm really hoping it does well in China and Japan, so it might get a sequel. Scott Mendelson is predicting a $95 million domestic gross for it, but it will likely fall short of $100 million at this point. Kong: Skull Island looks to end at its domestic run at about $160-170 million or so, and it's been doing great overseas. Looks to be a big success for Warner Brothers - it's nice to see iy outperform expectations, since many expected it to fail. Get Out continues to have great legs.

Not really much of a game so much as a story that you explore in first person. The soundtrack alone is pure art, and you can find it on YouTube easily. The stories of all the main characters aren't like most emotional games since they're all just regular people living in a simple village in England, but that makes the tragedies they face all the more real. Rather than the typical "military hero bro gets killed by bad guy to sad piano theme" it's real world, existential tragedies you're probably all too familiar with yourself.

I've sometimes had problems where my keyboard will either partially or entirely stop responding and I'll need to reboot. However, rebooting has not fixed my cursor disappearing.

Despite Trump's recklessness and any repercussions it might have on Israel's inside man in ISIS, the US remains an important ally to them and NATO countries. You still have a massive intelligence body that generates a lot of info that benefits these allies. You also have much more resources than they do, allowing you to analyze emerging info efficiently. And lastly, more than any other country in the world, you have the ability to act on intel provided quickly and efficiently. Even if Israel felt skeptical about Trump's administration and its relationship with the Russians, they'll come back to you because you have a massively powerful security apparatus and, unlike most other countries, are very eager to use it when the need arises. They could take the same info to Germany, China, UK, France, Canada, Australia, all of which have decent militaries, but those countries are far more cautious than you are when it comes to engaging targets in foreign territory. So, no, the media and a lot of other people are exaggerating when they suggest that America's allies will stop sharing their secrets because of this reckless act by Trump. 2017-05-17 07:50:57 reddit post the ricin is also a giveaway. seems to be a signature weapon of theirs 2017-05-16 14:26:13 reddit post You're welcome. :).

Obviously all the names are "strange" in one sense or another, but the only other team that was named after a local characteristic and then moved but kept the name is the Lakers.

Foote was a product of the early 20th century American South - a place where the government had been defined by white supremacy for decades. To deny that is to deny history. Frankly, if you're not operating in bad faith this stuff really isn't that difficult to grasp. 2017-02-28 00:36:23 reddit post I think you may have gotten to the core of the negative reaction to Coates' argument. You write that Coates is attacking whiteness, when in fact he is simply presenting a historical analysis. I assume you are white and see that as an attack on yourself, which in turn evokes an emotional reaction. Dr. Robin DiAngelo would [define this as white fragility.](http://libjournal.uncg.edu/ijcp/article/viewFile/249/116) White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. I encourage you to read her paper. 2017-02-28 00:27:43 reddit post Could you elaborate? It is impossible to find literary criticism from an author who has no particular viewpoint. 2017-02-27 23:27:02 reddit post If someone wants to argue that Foote is overly sympathetic to the Confederate cause they should critique Footes actual words, like you did by posting that paragraph from him, not by claiming that his "whiteness" prevented him from reaching the right conclusions. I pulled the Foote quote directly from Coates' article. If you followed the link you could clearly see Coates addresses Foote's actual words. I really didn't add much to the argument, it all comes from Coates. I explicitly wrote that you need to read the entire thing to get context. Ta-Nehisi Coates article is racist, plain and simple. I happen to agree that Foote was a bit to sympathatic to the "Cause," but that is due to my analysis of his arguments, which I can attribute to his attitudes, upbringing, and values, not the color of his skin. To declare Coates' analysis of Foote as racist is baffling, again please read the entire article. In analyzing Foote's view of the Civil War you can not separate his upbringing and values with his race - they are, in essence, one and the same. 2017-02-27 21:03:58 reddit post Ta-Nehisi Coates' Atlantic piece [The Convenient Suspension of Disbelief](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/06/the-convenient-suspension-of-disbelief/240318/) argues that ultimately Foote was sympathetic to confederate figures and not to slaves, simply because he could see himself as a confederate and not as a slave. He gave twenty years of his life, and three volumes of important and significant words to the Civil War, but he he could never see himself in the slave. He could not get that the promise of free bread can not cope with the promise of free hands. Shelby Foote wrote The Civil War, but he never understood it. Understanding the Civil War was a luxury his whiteness could ill-afford. I pulled this passage from an interview that accompanies the story, it is important to read the entire thing to get context. INTERVIEWER: Had you been alive during the Civil War, would you have fought for the Confederates? FOOTE: No doubt about it. What's more, I would fight for the Confederacy today if the circumstances were similar. There's a great deal of misunderstanding about the Confederacy, the Confederate flag, slavery, the whole thing. The political correctness of today is no way to look at the middle of the nineteenth century. The Confederates fought for some substantially good things. States rights is not just a theoretical excuse for oppressing people. You have to understand that the raggedy Confederate soldier who owned no slaves and probably couldn't even read the Constitution, let alone understand it, when he was captured by Union soldiers and asked, What are you fighting for? replied, I'm fighting because you're down here. So I certainly would have fought to keep people from invading my native state. There's another good reason for fighting for the Confederacy. Life would have been intolerable if you hadn't. The women of the South just would not allow somebody to stay home and sulk while the war was going on. It didn't take conscription to grab him. The women made him go. Foote is an excellent story teller but it is difficult to agree that he did not contribute to a body of text from which, in part, white nationalism claims.

When he says "it's time for the country to get together" he hasn't yet realized that as a leader, he needs to be doing that work.

Next, *Devos* and *Carson*. Eminently unqualified, with potential to harm everyday people, everyday, and also, with education, harm generations of children.

FDR defined the Democratic party as "new deal" or generally government safety net programs and concern for the poor, government choreography of economy (fed), etc. Obama while a fine president did not change or redefine the Democratic party, just furthered its goals that had already been established. 2017-01-17 13:31:33 reddit post Don't forget leap years 2017-01-17 01:25:55 reddit post https://youtu.be/zgHHph-CrC8 2017-01-16 18:00:40 reddit post Clearly this guy wasn't famous enough. 2017-01-16 16:59:41 reddit post Here's where I find to be troubling. If we were to give him the most benefit of the doubt about his real beliefs on race, then For most people, after being explicitly rebuked and rejected by the Senate for racism, they would then have some self-reflection and wonder where people get the idea that you're racist. Then, make sure to run as far away as possible from anyone or anything that even smells of racism. Yet he seems to constantly accidentally having racist opinions and first to stand up together with racists, and very enthusiastically so.

Gaza was part of Egypt, West Bank was part of Jordan and Golan was part of Syria. Israel took them during a defensive war (anyone who tells you that because Israel was the aggressor in 67 is ignorant (willfully or otherwise) of the context of that war), until that point there were no calls for an independent Palestinian nation (outside of getting rid of Israel), and there were certainly no calls for Jordan and Egypt to end their "occupation" of those territories, including Jerusalem (which was supposed to be a neutral, internationally administered territory for everyone, until Jordan unilaterally conquered it in 48 and kicked out the Jews). So essentially these peoples did have their own "countries", which were conquered defensively after being attacked. But here we are. So I don't think that's the goal. 2017-01-15 23:31:31 reddit post Ireland did it. The two Germanies did.

The 1 area where tesla loses to other high end sports cars is the continuing acceleration after hitting 60 (tesla racing channel vs Aventador). Tesla p90dl is 60-130 in 11.6, whereas the Aventador is 7.1. Huge difference. Additionally in the movie, the modes were about does not necessarily acceleration. Could plaid mode be longer acceleration power? Or maybe 200+ top speed?

I usually watch movies as a way to zone out when stressed out tired. Mild entertainment, and not too emotionally or intellectually invested in the movie. I only really watch, maybe once a month, at most. Therefore I don't watch many dramas or thrillers etc. Just stupid comedies and some action films and family animation films. It doesn't mean I don't appreciate those other films, or enjoy them, when I have the time or emotional space to give them. It's just not a high priority for me, and not how I choose to watch. Therefore, if recommended a "serious" or "artsy" film, I won't get around to it for a very long time, and if I boiled the reason down, it would be that I have to pay attention to it, and I don't feel like paying attention. 2016-12-28 01:47:49 reddit post Everyone seems to be talking about the Suzuki method, 10000 hours of practice, etc. That's not the question here. The question is why, within and among those who practice, there are some who outshine their peers, and also some who seem to have a head start. Clearly, Mozart, who began performing at 3 had innate talent - after all, he wasn't even alive for 10000 hours yet. Starting with the latter, it might be that some people have better hearing (more in tune, including up to pitch perfect hearing), some have better fine motor skills (pick up intricate finger motions and delicate dexterity), some have better rythm or math skills to understand the underlying scale and complexity of music, with, when combined with a more creative mind and problem solving skills, can create music that is great. With sports, obviously, tall people have more "innate" basketball talent; people with enlarged hearts can perform better at stamina and aerobic sports (marathon; racing; swimming). People talk about Phelps odd body, which is uniquely suited to swimming fast (long arms, wide hands and toes, tapered torso, etc) So there are physical aspects to becoming great at something. With some sports, like football, Tom Brady is known to be great because he understands the psychology of football, which means he can exploit certain things better. This means, being intelligent and creative makes for a better or more talented player, not just body. If course, some people are naturally stronger, faster and more fit, which will definitely help with sports. This is why, it's not just practice, people at professional level of sports, music, art etc all practice for thousands of hours, yet there is only one Gretzky, Jordan, Mozart, Picasso etc. 2016-12-28 01:33:23 reddit post Mozart wasn't even alive for 10000 hours before he was known as a musical prodigy and composing music. Was he not talented? I guess the question op is asking semantics, but what makes some people savant? Clearly, in professional sports, they are all putting in thousands of hours of practice, and besides for physical uniqueness (like Lance Armstrong and Michael Phelps), there is a reason Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky dominate their sports, and it's not just the practice 2016-12-27 16:27:21 reddit post Full autonomous driving (Punch in coordinates, go to sleep).

Hebrew was regularly spoken and studied and used in prayer from ancient times through today. Most jewish scholars published, and they are almist all in Hebrew. The Mishna, rashi, tosafot, rishonim, tur and shulchan aruch, and even all the writings of the maharal himself was written in Hebrew. The majority of prayers, which are about 60 pages recited by jewish people daily is in Hebrew. If anything, Aramaic is less commonly used because of how few books and prayers were written in it, even though it wasn't entirely uncommon, as mentioned above. This is why Kabbalah is written in Aramaic, because it's slightly less accessible than Hebrew to the common folk. Also, according to jewish lore, angels can't understand Aramaic, so to bypass angels, and go directly to god, they believe in using Aramaic. Hence the use of Aramaic in kabbalist magic 2016-12-23 01:29:18 reddit post No. The Zohar was written in Aramaic. Jews have always spoken and studied in local languages, but also in Hebrew, Yiddish and Aramaic. The Talmud is in Aramaic, as are other texts and liturgies. So, basically all Jews everywhere were familar with the language to some extent (kaddish, one of the most basic and famous prayers is in Aramaic). They would not have considered Aramaic to be foreign or exotic at all. The Zohar is the seminal kabbalist text. Written in Spain (Moses de Leon or something) in Aramaic. 2016-12-22 20:47:14 reddit post Maharal lived in Prague. Kabala is jewish mysticism. Maharal was a mystic.

Any modern Hebrew speaker can pick up an ancient Hebrew text and read it fine. Some technical words would be different or semantically different. There was basically one grammar change to accommodate creation of new words (-on suffix to imply relation). Ancient Israelites could drop in and read modern Hebrew, but many words would be new for new inventions and concepts. All in all remarkably similar. 2016-12-22 16:00:55 reddit post I guess that's all fine then, after all the current president elect is doing the same thing Snowden is still in contact with Russian intelligence, House report charges 2016-12-22 16:00:13 reddit post 2016-12-22 02:35:13 reddit post Question on a similar vein: Food with heat have capsaicin which activate heat receptors in the mouth.

Through gradual expansion of medicaid at the federal and state level, and the expansion of medicare, as well. Something like this: Medicaid: as already happening: gradually raise the floor, so more and more middle class people become eligible, also, children specific Medicaid under other names will be expanded. Both will also be expanded by having tiers ranging from free to higher premiums as parents are better off, this will eventually include standard Medicaid. Eventually this will expand to include more and more income brackets. Medicare: eventually we will get the option for 55 and older to buy in (for money) info medicare. This will be sold as away to save Medicare financially (infusion of cash, infusion of less frequent users in the pool). The age will gradually come down, and the cash cost will eventually become a tax, and will just be regular medicare, watch over time will expand to include more and more ages. 2016-12-12 02:55:09 reddit post They rely so little on fact, as it is, and only perception.

Reason being that there was a plane crash (shortly after 9/11) in Queens new York shortly after takeoff. It was determined that this incident was caused, in part, by excessive turbulence in the air from a jet that took off just before it. Winglets were found to dramatically decrease turbulence caused by the close confluence of differently pressurized air at the wing tips. This would have prevented the crash, and it was found to increase flight efficiency and stability, etc. Military planes have different mission requirements. 2016-12-11 21:24:47 reddit post Is that why McMullin was an intelligence agent? 2016-12-11 17:58:18 reddit post Whic is unfortunate, IMH(unpopular)O.

This is incredible, said the man. Who in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Final and not use it? The neighbour says, Well actually the seat belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she passed away. This is the first World Cup Final we havent been to together since we got married. Oh, Im so sorry to hear that. Thats terrible.But couldnt you find someone else, a friend, relative or even a neighbour to take her seat? The man shakes his head. No, he says. Theyre all at the funeral. one of my favourite jokes. 2017-05-13 04:20:14 reddit post There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living. He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas. "You know what? No," said the executioner. "I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now." Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. The man looked at the executioner and said "Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."

A normal individual will produce the required amount of acid and enzymes at the right time, but no more. Perhaps very fatty food disrupts this process - it's possible but I cannot say because I don't know for sure. When you are getting acid reflux, that indicates a problem with the valve/shincter that lets food into the stomach but not back out. When it is not functioning correctly, the stomach contents can be forced back out, the wrong way. Again, I'm certainly no medical expert so you may want to do your own research. 2017-05-06 15:02:41 reddit post From what I was told, most people start on 40 mg and then go back to 20. I did this. I find that only about one day a month I get serious breakthrough. So I don't worry and just keep taking 20 mg. I have also found that if I take too much, my food doesn't digest properly and I throw up pretty much what looks like the food I ate, with the consistency of peanut butter. Last time it happened I gorged myself on cashews and I reckon I could have put them back together after they came up. I have GORD, you might too. I would go back to the doctor. You may need more. But I'm not a doctor, so you should really speak to an expert. 2017-05-06 14:57:51 reddit post Cheers mate. 2017-05-06 14:57:04 reddit post HCl is a strong acid - it completely separates into H+ and Cl- ions in water - that is the definition of strong with regard to acids. But you must remember that the concentration of the acid in any situation is just as important. Yes we have 'strong' acid in our stomach but it it isn't that concentrated - hence the enzymes that help out. If you made a solution of HCl at the same concentration as is in our stomach, you would find that you could stick your hand in it for quite a while before it really hurt. You notice it burns and stings a bit when you vomit - it's coming into contact with some pretty sensitive mucous membranes but it isn't that bad, just unpleasant. I can personally say I know, because I have done it many times, with both hydrochloric and sulfuric acids. It gets on your skin and after a while it starts to itch and burn so you just wash it off. You will know when it's really concentrated, trust me. I used to work with it all the time and was never very careful with safety. It's your eyes you must worry about. Wear those fucking goggles if you value your eyesight. 2017-05-06 14:46:54 reddit post Thanks. I'll keep that in mind 2017-05-06 14:46:31 reddit post Thanks mate.

Much of the work is done by enzymes, in conjunction with the acid. Furthermore, the acid is produced as needed. You don't walk around with half a litre of concentrated acid sloshing around. The acid is produced by special cells. Some people, like me, have over active ones. We take drugs known as proton pump inhibitors, so we don't make too much acid (protons). 2017-05-06 09:36:51 reddit post Fair enough - looking at you made me laugh. 2017-05-06 09:33:49 reddit post Where? 2017-05-06 09:27:17 reddit post I'm down to 2 or 3 litres of beer (5% volume) a night. It used to be two bottles of rum a day and as much beer and port as I could scoff before passing out. I would skoll middie glasses (285 mL) of port if I felt I was not drunk enough. Just drank the rum straight from the bottle, all day. Then go to the pub and sink piss with me mates until it closed. Then I got caught drink driving. I'd been to the pub that morning. Probly had 10 or 11 schooners (425 mL) of beer. But not before I'd had half a bottle of rum before I got there. Then I went home and drank a bottle of port and went to sleep. Went to buy some drugs and got nabbed because I forgot to put my headlights on. After that, I decided that perhaps this wasn't the life for me. Drinking less is hard but I'm no fan of this idea that because you had a problem you can never drink at all. 2017-05-06 09:18:49 reddit post Keep goin' man. 2017-05-06 09:16:04 reddit post A good mate of mine died recently from exactly the same thing. He just couldn't stop drinking. We tried to get him to eat food - we would cook up real nice stuff and literally beg him to eat even one bite. But he couldn't. He'd just politely decline. By the end, he was skeletal, suffering from severe pancreatitis and in agonising pain. Drinking made the pancreatitis worse but not drinking was impossible. All he would do was shuffle around wherever he was (him and his best mate, Warbs would cruise around in a van, from house to house selling drugs - Paedo and Warbs went everywhere together) and continue to drink cheap apple cider. The last time I ever saw him, he was carrying a 2 litre bottle of cider which he could barely lift and making jokes about his health. He left behind a missus and four kids. We miss ya, Paedo.

How many times do I have to say it? I don't pay for games unless they are near perfect. And Bethesda have a long way to go in that regard. Yes, I put up with the bugs. No, I am not paying for the privilege, anymore. Take, for instance, Witcher 3 - absolute ball-tearer of a game. Bigger and better than any Bethesda game and almost completely devoid of bugs. NO game breaking ones and only the most minor of other ones. Will I pay for that? Fucken oath I will. I'm playing it for the second time at the moment.

It simply states a reaction has Kc = 1.5 where A(g) = 2B(g) What happens when 3 moles of each are put into the flask? I said A decreases and B increases, as the ratio is 1:2. But the answer is the opposite of what I thought. Why? The other question says Kc = 1.6 x 10-10 for the reaction: 2SO3(g) = 2SO2(g) + O2(g) Then it asks what Kc is for: SO2(g) + 1/2O2(g) = SO3(g) It's the same reaction, just backwards. I thought the rate would be the same but opposite. Apparently, that is not the case. The answer is 7.9 x 104. Can someone tell me why? Also - how do you do subscripts here? 2017-05-06 04:26:47 reddit post Don't sell faulty products. I refuse to pay for shit that's broken. Every single Bethesda game I have ever played has horrendous bugs. They need to stop it with this pre-order crap and release games when the fucking things are actually ready. Would you expect your money back if you bought a shirt and it fell apart after wearing it a few times? I would. Steam can take your money for a game and refuse to give it back after only two hours of play - if the bugs manifest themselves after that, you're fucked. And that has happened to me once too often. Fuck Bethesda and fuck Steam. I mean look at the giant day one bug for Fallout 4, just for a quick example. Go near certain areas and the game crashes to desktop. Happened across multiple platforms. They simply MUST have known about it, yet they release the game, anyway. Suckers like me pay for it and get stung on day one. Sorry, but I do not pay for that, anymore. 2017-05-06 04:15:19 reddit post How do you figure that? I like playing them but the bugs are bad enough for me to refuse to pay.

Pirating until Bethsoft and Steam change their tune. 2017-05-05 16:18:27 reddit post To be honest, toluene probably won't help you in a naturally aspirated road car. Modern fuels have enough knock resistance to drive any average car pretty hard. Toluene would let you advance timing significantly but it's still probably a waste of time. High performance turbocharged engines would be a different story - but you aren't going for economy there - you are going for performance and reliability. That's where you you would use toluene - so you can wind up the boost pressure to stupid levels without the thing shitting itself in an instant. The fuel blend you buy at the pump is pretty damn good. If it weren't, some company would capitalise on that real quick. And if you use fuel that is significantly different, your car's management system would not be able to cope and something might be damaged. Most engine management systems are designed to advance the timing until the onset of knock, retard it and repeat that process. Using some exotic fuel would be outside the window of their capabilities. You could approach the various oil companies if you wanted to try it out but I doubt it would be worth it. At high levels of toluene, the fuel doesn't vaporise properly and you need to heat it - I'm not sure at what point that would be - you'd have to consult the tables to see what vaporises at what temperature and compare it. Sorry to disappoint but basically fuel companies have this sewn up. No one is going to sell or use TEL, which would in theory be the answer to your question. Feel free to ask any other questions you have. I'll do my best. 2017-05-05 16:01:30 reddit post Is that a bad thing? 2017-05-05 15:55:47 reddit post EVERY time I want to do anything with fucking Steam, I have to get a code from my email to verify it's me, on the same computer, on the same fucking day.

I saw Gerhard Berger saying you had to get on the throttle up to two seconds early and try and anticipate when the power would come on - power could literally double in the space of 1000 revs on the tacho. One mistake and you just slide off. 2017-05-05 09:29:42 reddit post The rest was n-heptane to meet the FIA requirements. Toluene isn't really any better or worse than the blends of petrol we use anywhere else (it is also a component in most blends of petrol) in terms of safety. It's just super effective at preventing detonations. Try not to get it on yourself and don't wash your hands in it, etc. The usual safety precautions. Many octane boosting products contain large amounts of it. Yes, it is carcinogenic like a vast array of hydrocarbons but it's not a huge problem if you handle it safely. It's very similar to benzene - it's just a benzene ring with a methyl group attached. Two questions I am having trouble with (equilibrium reactions) 2017-05-05 09:23:09 reddit post The first one is very simple but I got it wrong. It simply states a reaction has Kc = 1.5 where A(g) = 2B(g) What happens when 3 mol of each are put into the flask? I said A decreases and B increases, as the ratio is 1:2. But the answer is the opposite of what I thought. Why? The other question says Kc = 1.6 x 10^-10 for the reaction: 2SO3(g) = 2SO2(g) + O2(g) Then it asks what Kc is for: SO2(g) + 1/2O2(g) = SO3(g) It's the same reaction, just backwards. I thought the rate would be the same but opposite. Apparently, that is not the case. The answer is 7.9 x 10^4. Can someone tell me why? Also - how do you do subscripts here? 2017-05-05 06:52:42 reddit post I wish people would learn the difference between turbo lag and boost threshold. That thing never had 1500 hp, either. None of them did. No one had a dyno that went that high. They just estimated it - and it was closer to 1300 hp in qualifying guise. They were running up to 5.5 bar (80 psi) boost, so they had to use fuel that was ~84% toluene (methylbenzene) to combat knock. From what I had read, the engine life at that much boost was ~25,000 *cumulative* revs. That's it - two to three minutes for qualifying runs and then it died. 2017-05-05 06:22:50 reddit post An RUF. 2017-05-05 06:07:00 reddit post No, doing that will not leave any useful amount of N2 in the petrol - and I don't see how somehow dissolving nitrogen into petrol would do anything, anyway. All you will do is speed up the evaporation rate. Ethanol does not contain nitrogen. I'm not sure how that idea is supposed to work in therms of 'nitrogen enrichment' - whatever that is. Ethanol is an oxygenate - a fuel that already contains oxygen. You need to use more of it to get the same power. It also has lower energy density. It is a poor choice for a normal road going car. But it has excellent knock characteristics for racing. What would really help would be TEL - tetraethyl lead. A fantastic knock combating compound. But obviously you can't use it anymore. It is an excellent anti-knock compound. One of the best. The chemical I would use is toluene (methylbenzene). Toluene is possibly the best hydrocarbon fuel you could get for a petrol engine. In the 80s the Formula 1 cars used to it to allow them to run stupendous boost levels in the turbocharged cars. Some cars could run up to 5.5 bar (80 psi) of boost for short periods. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene 2017-05-05 05:38:51 reddit post Why did you delete your other comments? 2017-05-05 05:31:55 reddit post Oh no!

Take, for instance, piracy of software/copyright - there is no fucking way in hell an Australian agency is going to cooperate with the US. There was a famous case called the Dallas Buyer's Club (some lame US movie) - DBC marched into the Australian court system and demanded they be able to sue people under US style law. They were literally laughed out of court. The US plaintiffs thought they could sue people in Australia, just like they do in America. But it doesn't work like that. In Australia, we don't have punitive damages - you can't say someone is liable for untold amounts of money because they shared the movie dozens of times. All you can do is sue them for one copy of the movie. So, the DBC lawyers quickly found out that they could only sue people for about 30 bucks each. And the presiding judge made them apply for each and every case through him. Needless to say, the DBC lawyers quickly found out that we don't dance to American tunes. US law stops at US borders. 2017-05-03 14:36:20 reddit post Yep. It's fucking funny when dickheads get caught. I used to take great delight in reporting them when I worked in retail.

Though it kinda depended on the Wehrmacht commanders as some commanders had a more "do what you want to do just don't get in my way" approach but none had serious conflicts with the SS. 2017-04-25 10:43:33 reddit post at worst you still get the ticket so you don't have much to lose. 2017-04-25 10:41:09 reddit post From experiences my close relatives have unfortunately endured, they can persuade people who have been arrested for drug charges to stand in stings in exchange for lesser charges. But honestly when it happened to my relatives the cops didn't seem trustworthy so maybe a gray area. 2017-04-25 10:36:42 reddit post Also if by chance damages are not completely covered by insurance and you couldn't get damages from the guys who crashed, you can write off some damages in your mother's taxes. At least that was recommended to me when I was in a similar situation but the driver was not hostile. (Also CA) 2017-04-25 10:26:13 reddit post Thinking would the data on the save file be treated as software? Because if one deletes software a company invested thousands in that would seem like a case. (But yeah the damages of deleting a save file? Minuscule.) 2017-04-25 10:14:58 reddit post What... the bot what? Why? 2017-04-25 10:14:05 reddit post Aye 2017-04-25 05:04:53 reddit post Same I am full of medica, though now I have mage BSB finally 2017-04-24 08:11:52 reddit post My instructor stored code in word and pasted it into IDLE, he had to replace every " mark. 2017-04-24 08:03:53 reddit post But don't look at it as "good" or "evil". It's really your perspective and morals that matter, otherwise you will become biased over time. 2017-04-23 10:32:22 reddit post Ugh even though I agree nazi Germany did horrible things, that does not make their enemies good people. US servicemen executed SS officers. US took few Jap POW (there is jap code of honor involved), due to world politics US dropped A-bombs, Russia, shoot where do I start, just look up rape of Berlin. 2017-04-23 10:27:21 reddit post Ah thanks 2017-04-23 10:27:00 reddit post Thanks 2017-04-23 10:26:38 reddit post While it's not a bad idea to plan for worst scenario it feels bad to jump to worst scenario. 2017-04-23 10:17:00 reddit post Are all accounts with flairs lawyers?

Screw it most of WW2 was inexcusable and just screwed up. 2017-04-23 07:35:17 reddit post Thank you for your work good sir 2017-04-23 07:30:29 reddit post But it wasn't like WW2 rape of Berlin when there was a nasty vengeance and hatred streak going on. 2017-04-23 07:23:33 reddit post Marking this 2017-04-23 07:21:41 reddit post Why is this the only question answered 2017-04-23 07:19:53 reddit post Rome could do more but maybe that's because it was warlike and organized 2017-04-22 09:07:40 reddit post 1 second the boss deals 800 dmg, the next second 2800 dmg. 2017-04-21 21:30:52 reddit post I tried to be vague 2017-04-20 16:39:55 reddit post "Even our own blood... just not my sisters blood. 2017-04-20 16:38:27 reddit post I don't think so, death threats were posted by fringe alt-rights too many times. Such as death threats against victims and family of sandy hook, and in one case murder. Why? Something along the lines of sandy hook is a conspiracy back Obama and democrats to enact gun control laws. 2017-04-20 10:52:48 reddit post That is one hell of a post I'll get back to you later either tomorrow or more likely the weekend with my verdict. 2017-04-20 10:42:14 reddit post The best way to individually combat this is cite your sources and call into question other sources that appear to be untrustworthy. Some sources you won't need to state as untrustworthy or not such as a CDC (center for disease control) article on the flu as they have a reputation to uphold, direct accountability, and low to non-existent motive to mislead. Others such as a CNN report on republicans or a Fox report on democrats will need to be independently researched, before sharing or accepting as truth. Edit: minor grammar: democratic changed to democrats; non-motive changed to non-existent motive 2017-04-20 10:36:05 reddit post Hey it works on both sides of an election some that appear blatant lies to me are accepted as canon to others. One particular one I heard was "Hillary absolutely enjoyed ordering killings and that she had the most evil smirk" and that was said to me by my father, he believes it. 2017-04-20 10:30:47 reddit post And my point is it shouldn't come as a surprise that a man running for office be covered in controversy, a spotless man would cause me to worry more. (Just rereading some of the past elections and why do people want tabloid magazines when such things were printed in national newspapers in the past. They could just read a history book on the past elections) 2017-04-20 10:13:52 reddit post That these articles that wrote ill of Trump, only surfaced during the election, my response is once someone runs for office a lot more people have a lot more incentive to find and Air the dirty laundry of the person running, look on Hillary and emails, Libya; this is not just today's Trump and Hillary. Obama and birth certificates and speculation and him being Muslim. JFK and being catholic. (Really the earlier you go the more outrageous the claims are, Jackson the 'bride stealer' comes to mind) Anyone running for office, especially running for a high office like POTUS, will have a dreadful amount of scrutiny on them. Edit: removed the first sentence as it was no longer needed 2017-04-20 09:59:37 reddit post That is one hell of a ship, I can see a comedy out of it. 2017-04-20 09:57:53 reddit post i am sorry if I am coming across as rude but could you rephrase or edit your first paragraph? I am having trouble understanding it clearly and I hope to avoid misunderstandings. 2017-04-20 09:41:43 reddit post Don't stretch figures, it's a trait of Trump, don't be Trump. 2017-04-20 09:38:17 reddit post I only tried to find information about the donations to aids charities but I couldn't find anything viable after a 8 min search, could you maybe link your claims? 2017-04-20 09:35:14 reddit post What is evidence to you? i understand there is the 5th amendment that renders confessions obtained under duress void, but I don't think when they said/wrote/published/endorsed/ect those things that anyone had a gun to their head. 2017-04-20 09:30:24 reddit post If I posted my address and went on a vegan subreddit to say eating meat is much better than veggies I wouldn't have to fear for my safety. 2017-04-20 09:28:15 reddit post Dude chill that racism, this isn't the 18th century. 2017-04-20 09:25:57 reddit post Impersonation spot on 2017-04-20 08:27:52 reddit post Well while in the end he was a traitor, I heard Benedict was one fine general before he had enough of the continental congress screwing him and not recognizing his achievements. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Arnold He even tried to resign his commission to the continental congress a few times in disgust but was refused even that! 2017-04-20 08:20:08 reddit post Do note that due to Finland the USSR reorganized its military to be much more effective 2017-04-20 07:22:46 reddit post Really? I thought it was ok overall, minus the pot smokers but I never really heard anything too violent minus an incident where a mentally unstable person blew it a year or 2 ago and wound up killing a relative. But do you think I'm too deep in rose colored glasses or bc I live near the border with the north. 2017-04-20 04:49:08 reddit post ! 2017-04-20 04:44:45 reddit post How do these things work? Some programmer codes in an Easter egg? Or a logic error turns into a feature? 2017-04-20 03:54:52 reddit post Ah I meant quality of neighborhood. Sorry. Thanks in advance. 2017-04-20 03:46:07 reddit post That's pretty sweet 2017-04-19 23:23:08 reddit post Tapioca express is somewhat better than jamba, has its own unique-ish thing, and is 3-4 bucks for a smoothie 2017-04-19 23:21:32 reddit post What would you consider south natomas? 2017-04-19 23:17:01 reddit post I couldn't do avoidance once and now I'm dealing with the aftermath of a 10 car accident. (Some guy 4-6 cars behind me started the dominos of cars) 2017-04-19 23:14:46 reddit post It's not like the car behind you is going to bail you at freeway speeds, he will move you but perhaps not much more than 6 ft? (This is under the assumption that he hits you while he is going 35 and he is not driving a substantially bigger car, I.e. Smart car hit by hummer) 2017-04-19 23:05:36 reddit post II they killed the emperor of the largest empire that if let be would have developed the world at a faster pace. X resolved the problem of a huge ball of destruction so capital could be centralized easier, and not randomly destroyed, I think that is a bigger plus than the murderof a few prominent figures (sucide in the case of Mika) and downfall of the most influential organization known as yevon. XII prevents a total war so I think they did well in preventing a whole lot of loss, and cleared a few hunts. Tactics (WotL) other then preventing luvici, they indirectly enabled a machiavellian-like man become king (perhaps good for the economy?) but on the other hand they did increase the length of a major war by flooding a battlefield. And destroyed a revolution that would have redistribute wealth to reduce inequality thus bettering the economy (caused the leader to become a demon later on). And caused chaos by killing quite a few influential figures, but that I think was for the better. 2017-04-19 22:55:32 reddit post Hard to choose 2017-04-19 22:52:47 reddit post It immersed you from the get-go 2017-04-19 22:52:05 reddit post It did its function as an exposition so well, it covered the world and made it much more immersive. (And the battles between airships? That was pretty amazing) 2017-04-19 22:49:42 reddit post I have it on IOS (WotL) 2017-04-19 22:47:54 reddit post The main boss (not the super boss) isn't exactly evil, though at first you will be inclined to think so, and at the end you agree with him somewhat and feel bad for fighting him. 2017-04-19 22:34:50 reddit post The world was fleshed out and really immersive 2017-04-19 10:25:18 reddit post I always hear about certified mail, how expensive is it? (In case I wish to sell an IPhone via internet and want proof the purchaser received it) 2017-04-19 10:00:27 reddit post Honestly from what I hear 'the wheels of justice grind finely' at least in the US. Some of the maximum sentences are pretty ridiculous, and most of the US prison system is focused much more on the punishment side rather than rehabilitation. 2017-04-19 09:52:40 reddit post Well even with acceleration and deceleration, using the mean value theorem (MVT) they could theoretically bag you for speeding if you were. (IE speed limit is 60, you drive 60 miles in 50 minutes. MVT states you were above 60 at least twice,) 2017-04-19 09:44:59 reddit post Mine has been colonized and dominated by Bermuda grass, very drought resistant. Pity I am likely mildly allergic to it. 2017-04-19 09:43:57 reddit post Evergreens can be a pain in their own way though, they constantly shed branches and twigs, not a large amount, but large enough for you to have to clean every week. Also if you or a neighbor have allergies you may have a problem. 2017-04-19 09:35:09 reddit post Can someone tell me the resolution? 2017-04-19 07:41:34 reddit post Honestly I thought there was a 50% chance a picture of a cannon would be posted. 2017-04-19 03:07:22 reddit post What's the actual cannon 2017-04-18 22:00:10 reddit post You can get jntrouble with the law and PETA, and this guys are like the church of Scientology when they put you into their scopes 2017-04-18 21:58:32 reddit post Happy 2017-04-18 21:56:03 reddit post A bundle of needles will be your loot. 2017-04-18 20:45:27 reddit post I did it but it takes a while. 2017-04-18 20:39:07 reddit post Out of curiosity why didn't he instead mothball the fleet? 2017-04-18 10:17:28 reddit post Did they ever state the name of Yuna's mother, or Tidus's mother? 2017-04-18 10:07:48 reddit post Sweet, when is it out again?

(160 difficulty and all lv 99 characters) 2017-04-18 03:53:12 reddit post Yeah that guy who started it is screwed (on the bright side 1 driver pulled out so now only 8 drivers involved) also if I had full coverage I would not have to deal with this as my insurance would be dealing with this. 2017-04-17 22:33:35 reddit post Love smugly saying 'I got OK gauntlets off banner, no worries maybe it will happen to you' 2017-04-17 10:28:44 reddit post Confusion everywhere 2017-04-17 09:59:33 reddit post I got the OK BSB as an off-banner draw 2017-04-17 09:51:17 reddit post Oh dam, doing it with a physical team was hell, affliction break probably kept us afloat. Brought lenna BSB just to see how it was in MP and by chance the reraise helped. But yeah don't do physical it takes way too long. 2017-04-17 08:26:28 reddit post Dam yeah... I just might try it, it can't be worse then Tactics DK grinding. 2017-04-17 08:18:14 reddit post Glaudios (sp) dagger, Dustia, katana from werewoofs, ZODIAC SPEAR (if done right and with zone out exploit) 2017-04-17 08:16:08 reddit post Will it work on IOS?

(3x but in occasionally became slower if PC was taxed A better grind spot would be Dustia (btw will that be in the zodiac age?) 2017-04-17 08:01:55 reddit post Honestly a while back I did not know that until I saw the prequel(?) because I was confused on what people meant. 2017-04-17 07:57:17 reddit post FF tactics war of the lions will keep you entertained for months. It's story is sweet, and it's quite customizable giving it high replay value. Only thing you might not like is it's tactics, much more emphasis on strategy rather than mashing attack. (Though if you go nuts and grind like I do and have triple the level than your opponent...) 2017-04-17 07:52:42 reddit post Man and I just beat the game. It's has great dialogue, great music, and in my opinion great gameplay (though I wish the bosses were higher level, my lv 70 characters just pubstomped the final 4 battles like nothing.
